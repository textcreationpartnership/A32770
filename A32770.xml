            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> SINS of the Elect are not forgiven immediately upon, nor meerly by Chriſt's Enduring Sufferings, but there were by Divine Appointment to interpoſe a Goſpel Promiſe, of Pardon, the Work of the Spirit, for a Conformity to the Rule of the Promiſe in the Perſon to be pardoned, and a Judicial Act of Pardon by that Promiſe on the Perſon thus conformed to the Rule thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> The Goſpel hath another Sanction to the Preceptive Part of the Law, than the Covenant of Works had: Though nothing be abated in the Rule of Sin and Duty, yet Bleſſings are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Lower Degrees of Duty, and a continuance in a ſtate of Death with a Barr to the Bleſſing, are not threatned againſt every Degree of Sin as the Covenant of Works did.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> This Change of the Sanction ſuppoſeth the Death of Chriſt, and his honouring the Law by his perfect Obedience, wherein God hath provided for his own Glory, while he promiſeth Life by Forgiveneſs to Imperfect Man, and yet inſiſts on ſome Degrees of Obedience, to which of his meer Grace he enableth us.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> The [Degrees of Obedience] the Covenant of Redemption ſecures to the Elect, tho' the Grant therein is pleadable only by Chriſt as the ſtipulating Party for us; and our Perſonal Claim depends upon the Goſpel Covenant, whereof Chriſt is Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> The Goſpel-Sanction determins as certain a Rule of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery as the Law of Works did, tho' it be not the ſame; for while it promiſeth a Pardon to all believing repenting Sinners, and declares a Barr to Pardon to the Impenitent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of Chriſt and Goſpel-Grace, it fixeth true Repentance and Faith unfeigned to be the Terms of Pardon.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> When it promiſeth Heaven to the ſincerely holy perſevering Believer, it fixeth ſincere Holineſs and Perſeverance in Faith as the Terms of poſſeſſing Heaven.</p>

                     <hi>7.</hi> Hence the uſe of Faith and Holineſs as to thoſe Benefits is not fron the Conformity to the Precept, but their Conformity to the Rule of the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Our applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and relying on it, would no more Juſtifie us, than our Holineſs would Save us, were it not for the Goſpel-Promiſe, God will juſtifie for Chriſt's ſake all ſuch as believe.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> God in diſpenſing Goſpel-promiſed Bleſſings, doth judicially determine a Conformity to this Rule of the Promiſe. When he forgives, he judicially declares a Man hath true Faith; when he admits to Heoven, he judicially declares a Man ſincerely holy and perſevering.</p>

                  <p>TWO Gentlemen, who had for their Recreation walk'd forth into the Fields in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> happened to fall into Company together, and after mutual Salutation, and general Diſcourſes of News, (having not as yet a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acquaintance, or Knowledge one of another) one of them among many things mentioned by him that were great ground of Sadneſs to a conſidering and gracious Mind, ſaid, He was moſt affected with and grieved at the great Eclipſe fallen of late upon the Doctrine of the Goſpel, inſomuch that for the Doctrine of Juſtification eſpecially we are in a manner returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of Juſtification by Works being brought into the room of Juſtification by Faith, and only varniſh'd over with the Profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the change of a few Terms which are uſed to the ſame purpoſe that the former were.</p>
                  <p>The other Gentleman look'd hard upon him while he thus ſpake, and ſaid, Have you ſeen a Book lately come forth, called, <hi>Goſpel-Truth Stated and Vindicated?</hi> It's a Book much talked of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Yes, Sir, ſaid the other, I have ſeen the Book and read moſt of it, but I will aſſure you I was much grieved at the reading of it. <hi>I pray your Reaſons.</hi> He replyed, Pray Sir, excuſe me there.

                     <hi>The other return'd,</hi> I begin to have ſome Apprehenſions what your Principles are; I find you are an <hi>Antinomian:</hi> I pray what is your Name? I crave your Excuſe, Sir, <hi>you have given me a Name,</hi> you may call me by that, or what you pleaſe; for by this I do as well ken you: For I know of what Principles thoſe Men are of, that are ſo ready to aſperſe the Aſſerters of the Doctrine of Free-Grace with the Reproachful Name of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> the true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which Sect, and moſt ancient, is from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, that they took occaſion <hi>from the Doctrine of Free-Grace, to plead for and practiſe all manner of Licentiouſneſs.</hi>

The other Gentleman replied: As for <hi>Luther,</hi> he was an <hi>Antinomian</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Calvin</hi> but a little better, according to the Opinion of our Modern Divines. We ſay they are <hi>Antinomians</hi> that deny Juſtification to be by Faith as a conditional receiving Act, and by Repentance as a qualifying Act; and that the continuation of our Juſtification is by Works: Theſe Men which you name, and their Followers indeed pretend to Holineſs, but they aſcribe not that to it which they ought, for the Honour of God's Rectoral Rule of Government.</p>

                     <p>If theſe be the Men you call <hi>Antinomians,</hi> they are falſely ſo called. I think they that come neareſt to the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles are the moſt Orthodox; and I know no ſuch Doctrine that they have taught, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what you call Orthodox; you ſeem to be of the Sect-truly call'd <hi>Neonomians,</hi> becauſe they aſſert, That the Goſpel is a new Law, the Condition whereof is <hi>imperfect, ſincere, perſevering Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which I take to be no other than a Covenant of Works.</p>

                        <hi>I am indeed of that Opinion, and my Scheme is according thereunto.

                     <p>i. e. <hi>It doth eſtabliſh the New Law, not the Old; we are for a Law, and Juſtification by it, tho' not for the Old: For</hi> Paul <hi>ſtill oppoſeth the Law, of Faith and the Works of that Law to the Old Law,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Law of Perfect Obedience.

I can't perſwade my ſelf that the Compoſure of that piece of Work that hath ſo much <hi>Moral Evil</hi> in it, and bitter Oppoſition to Goſpel-Truth, is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Prayers; neither can I pray as thoſe Gentlemen, whoſe Names ſtand over your Porch, but think it my Duty to pray quite contrary; and as for what you ſpeak of Revival of Errors, I judge that your Dictates are no Rule to judge of Faith and Error by, how magiſterially ſoever you impoſe them: And I think we are come to a ſad paſs, if a Man of your declared Principles muſt be ſet up as a Reformer of Error, and Former of Articles of Faith, and ſuch as are in Fundamental Points directly contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Part of the 39 Articles; yea, ſuch as our firſt Proteſtant Reformers decryed by Scripture and the beſt Arguments, as highly Antichriſtian, and deſtructive to the Souls of Men; which Witneſs of theirs many of them ſealed with their Blood. You ſay, the Danger of ſuch things as you call Error, will be in excluding the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56391:7"/> Teaching of your Doctrine and Miniſtry as Legal. Would to God ſuch Miniſtry as the Spirit of God call's Legal Preaching, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the brighter Shining of the Grace of God into the Hearts both of Miniſters and People; from which Light ſome, and too many this Day have ſwerved, having turned aſide unto vain Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, deſiring to be Teachers of the Law; underſtanding <hi>neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affivm,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. But you call that Evangelical, which we call Legal: We can't help your calling Light Darkneſs, and Darkneſs Light; Law, Goſpel; and Goſpel, Law; and you ſay it's moſt apt in its own Nature to ſecure the Power of Religion: Whereas Experience hath ſhewed to the contrary, how well the Doctrine of Juſtification by Works hath ſecured it among the Romaniſts: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies by the Spirit, <hi>That whoſoever is juſtified by a Law</hi> [it's not <hi>the</hi> Law] <hi>is fallen from Grace,</hi> Gal. 5.4. And therefore its falſe that ſuch Doctrine is Chriſt's Ordination. It hath not Fitneſs in it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Souls, for the Law brings none to God: No Man is juſtifyed in or by a Law in the Sight of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. Thoſe Places, and divers others, ſhould be read <hi>a Law,</hi> and not <hi>the Law,</hi> becauſe the Spirit by them excludes all Laws, even your Law: Its <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; the emphatical Particle is not put in, and therefore there's no ground to ſay this or that Law only is excluded from Juſtification, but every Law; and where there's no true Juſtification taught, there can be no true Practical Obedience. But the laſt Prejudice is, <hi>That ſuch Doctrines as are oppoſite to yours, renders <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among Chriſtians a thing impoſſible.</hi> Good Reaſon there is for it, becauſe they can't unite in their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and therefore can't unite as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

But you expreſs the Effects of this dangerous Doctrine to lie in theſe things: 1. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in Sin:</hi> A Doctrine that quickens Men that are dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins, (one part of which Death is Security in Sin,) doth not cauſe Security in Sin: But the Doctrine of Free Grace in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a Sinner, without Works of any Law, doth ſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. I ſhall not now enlarge upon you. 2. Another ill Effect is, you ſay, That <hi>it cauſes the miſtaking the Motions of ſenſible Paſſions for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> This is rather the Effect of your own Doctrine, wherein you lay the whole Streſs of Juſtifying and Saving Grace upon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Paſſions, and ſet Men wholly to judge of their State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. It's marvellouſly to be wondred at, that any Man ſhould have the Impudency to charge thoſe Effects upon an oppoſite Doctrine to his, which are the natural and palpable Effects of his own, and he ſees ſo to be. 3. You charge upon it <hi>the general Abatement of an exact and humble walking.</hi> This Charge is likewiſe of the ſame Nature: Whereas the Spirit of God hath diſclaimed any true Cauſe of exact walking, beſide the Grace of God that brings Salvation, and then teacheth it, as hath been proved. As for Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking, what is a greater Inducement thereto than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, which aſcribes all to the Gift of Grace, empties us of every high Imagination and Thought? It exalts Chriſt, and makes him all and in all. Whereas yours is the contrary: no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tends more to the lifting up of the Creature than that of <hi>Neonomianiſm,</hi> next to that of the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>And no wonder, ſay you, when ſo many <hi>affirm ſuch and ſuch things.</hi> Where are the <hi>many</hi> or the <hi>any</hi> that you can charge with ſaying theſe things in the ſame Sence you put upon them? Many Expreſſions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56391:11"/> that taken together with their Connexion in the explained Sence of him that ſpeaks, are not only true, but ſafe and ſound; but abſtracted and wreſted, may be made to look as black as Hell.

                     <p>Your Teſtimony is againſt the Truth, as ſhall be made appear, and is not to be accounted a Teſtimony. For a Teſtimony is a credible Witneſs or Evidence: As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our Teſtimony among you was believed,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.10. And this Teſtimony is <hi>with a good Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. And <hi>Paul teſtified the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> Acts 2.24. 1. Your Teſtimony is not to the Goſpel of the Grace of God, but againſt it, and therefore not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially true. 2. Your Teſtimony is formally naught, it being not accompanied with a good Conſcience, but with a purpoſe and deſign to deceive. You pretend to do Good, but you manifeſtly deſign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; to blaſt the Honour of God's Free Grace, as if it were a Sin-teaching Doctrine, and blacken a Holy Servant of Chriſt (who is now in Glory) for Preaching the Goſpel: your Teſtimony can't be believ'd, becauſe of your manifold Prevarications, Equivocations, and Falſe Teachings in this Treatiſe of yours. And whereas you ſay you have ſtudied Plainneſs; if you mean that, in ſome places is no better than plain Falſhood, in others plain Error, it's true enough: Or if you mean Plainneſs in reſpect of Style, it's homely enough, and hardly plain Sence: But if you mean Plainneſs of Simplicity, without double-tonguedneſs, I utterly deny it: For when you ſpeak of things, that one would think at firſt Glance you intend Truth by, it's nothing ſo: No Jeſuite in the World can out-do you at Equivocation, and there lies your Natural Excellency: You have impertinent Repetition enough, your Conceſſions every where fall about your own Ears in your glozing Oppoſitions to the Truth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56391:12"/> you deny: You deſign the rectifying the Miſtakes of the Non-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent.

                     <p>This muſt be true or falſe, and here is the turning Point of the <hi>whole</hi> Book; Either Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> was, or you muſt be.— If you have not miſrepreſented him, then according to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation he was ſo: If you have miſrepreſented him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly blackened him, what are you? But that which we have in hand is Falſhood and Lying. As to this Aſſertion of yours, we ſhall prove you guilty of Falſhood throughout the Book, that though you have repeated ſome of Dr. <hi>Criſp's</hi> Words from time to time, yet you have only repeated ſuch part of his Words as might render him odious, not thoſe that give a true and can did Sence of what he intended; and herein you miſrepreſented him, and that on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Now the Spirit of God lays the Formal Nature of a Lie upon an Intention to deceive, or to deal injuriouſly with others, as in the Caſe of <hi>Doeg.</hi> Though I do not deſign now to come to Particulars, I will give one Inſtance wherein you in your Book, and your Party, do frequently expoſe Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> and his Abettors, ſuch as you call Divers, as alſo <hi>Criſpians</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that he and they do aſſert, <hi>Sin can do no hurt;</hi> and you would have Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he means, That no Perſon in Chriſt need fear to commit Sin, and that Sin in it's Abſtract Nature is good: That Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> renders Sin innocent, that is your Expreſſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 198. Now you charge him for ſaying, <hi>That the groſſeſt Sin that a Believer can commit can't do him the leaſt harm, neither ought they to fear the leaſt hurt by their own Sins,</hi> pag. 181. By this you would give us to underſtand, that he means <hi>Sin is in its ſelf Innocent,</hi> and that Sin bears no Evil Fruits of its ſelf; that it may be boldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without Fear. Whereas Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> declares plainly, and with much endeavour to prevent Miſtakes, that the Hurt he means is only the <hi>Penal Effects</hi> of Sin; and declares again and again he ſpeaks this not to encourage Sin: He ſpeaks of the Sins of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Chriſt, they that are under the Dominion of Grace: <q>He ſpeaks not of Sins <hi>to be committed,</hi> but that theſe ought to be looked upon as the moſt odious and hateful things in the World, and that which here he doth ſpeak is only upon the Account of ſome poor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56391:12"/> diſtreſſed Conſciences, whoſe Sins lay ſo much upon them, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Souls were driven from the Grace of God in Chriſt.</q> For to prove this, take only a few of his Words, (you ſhall hear many more heareafter,) <hi>Dr. C. p.</hi> 513. <q>Thus I ſpeak of Sin, not as it ſmiles upon a Man with a promiſing Countenance before it be committed: For it is moſt dreadful and odious to the Faithful, as that which crucifyed the ſweeteſt Lord, but as already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lying upon the Conſcience of a Believer, endeavouring to drive him to deny the Free-Grace and Love of God, and the All-ſufficiency of Chriſt: In this regard it is crucifyed by Chriſt, and ſo a Believer need not be afraid of Sin, the Hand-writing of Ordinances is taken away.</q> His whole Diſcourſe is to evince, that the condemning Nature of Sin is taken away; the Fear he ſpeaks of is only in reſpect of Sins that a Believer hath fallen into, and to prevent their falling into unbelieving Deſpair. Now let any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Perſon judge whether you have not miſrepreſented Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> and baſely traduced him. You your ſelf ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <q>The Obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fact againſt the Precept ſhall not hurt, where the Sanction of the Law is anſwered.</q> I think this being duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is worſe than any thing Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> ſayeth.</p>
                     <p>I'll inſtance in one Miſrepreſentation more: For you charge him for holding the Uſeleſneſs and Unprofitableneſs of Holineſs, in ſaying, Graces and Holineſs do us not the leaſt Good.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> p. 41. Preaching upon Chriſt the way, ſheweth Chriſt to be the way to Juſtification, and ſaith, <q>You that are Believers are in a near way to Salvation. Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Such a near way Chriſt is, yet ſtill People will be cavilling. Where are good Works all this while? what juſtified by Faith alone? Saved by Chriſt alone? I tell you, if Chriſt be the way to Eternal Life, then Works are not the way, except they be Chriſt. But muſt we not work? Yea, but for other purpoſes: [<hi>i. e.</hi> than for Juſtification and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining eternal Life by them] the Lord hath propounded other Ends for which you are to work. <hi>Ye are bought with a price:</hi> That's done, therefore glorify God in your Bodies, being delivered out of the Hands of your Enemies, weare to ſerve him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</q> He ſaith much to this purpoſe, often ſpeaks in the High Commendation of Holineſs, but ſpeaks againſt putting it in the place of Chriſt. By theſe things we may ſee what Credit is to be given to you, when you make it ſo much of your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Pulpit and publick places, to charge Men and Books with ſaying thoſe things which they never ſpake, and meaning ſuch things

And let all Men judge whether you have not miſrepreſented this good Man, (whom in the end of this Preface you own to have been a holy Man: And could that be true, if you have not miſrepreſented him as to what he ſaid of Sin and Good Works?) and ſpoken here a very great Falſhood. Theſe two Proofs may ſerve to evince for the preſent, which alſo ſhall be made good that it is ſo in moſt, if not all the Chapters of your Book more or leſs. The great Quarrel you have with him is, that he makes it ſo much his buſineſs to vindicate the Honour of Free Grace, and of the Lord Jeſus, in our whole Salvation, and in Juſtification to exclude Works altogether. You talk of Works neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but how? You mean as a working Condition, whereby you put Works in the place of Chriſt, and mean as your Oracle plainly ſpeaks: For you are not ſo honeſt as he, but play the Jugler more.

                     <p>Here I ſee I muſt have a Care of my Crown. The Dr. <hi>Seraphicus</hi> holds up his Fiſt. Well Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> you ſhould go to School to learn new Principles in Divinity, if you lived in our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56391:14"/> Times. You did not conſider that God did not legally Elect you. But Sir, is not this a very inſolent thing of you to ſay, that the Purpoſe of God in Election was not a Legal Grant. Was it a Grant or no? Or was it an Election without a Grant? Is not God's Deſignation of Good a Grant ſo far as deſigned? Is not a chooſing in Chriſt before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without Blame before him in Love; A <hi>granting that we ſhould be holy and without Blame before him in Love,</hi> and predeſtinating us to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his Will:</hi> A Granting that we ſhould <hi>have the Adoption of Children.</hi> But you ſay, this was not Legal. What! Was it not lawful for God to do this according to the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Will? That we uſually mean, when we ſay a thing is not Legal. Or do you mean, God did not elect by a Law? If he had been bound by a Law to Elect, he had not Elected freely: For a free choice implies a Perſon under no Obligation external or previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his own intention and purpoſe. 2. You ſay, nor a formal Promiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> Explicit, you mean. It's enough that it's an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe to make a formal Promiſe; and as there was an Eternal Election, ſo there was an Eternal Promiſe, the Covenant of Grace between the Father and the Son being eternal: And it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that God's Purpoſe and Grace was given <hi>us in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3. We were no ſooner efect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the purpoſe and Grace of it was <hi>given us in Promiſe.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection eternal, the Promiſe eternal, both equally eternal <hi>in puncto Eternitatis;</hi> though in Nature Election is before the Promiſe, and the Cauſe of it. 3. You ſay, the Decree includes the Means and the End. Do you think Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> did not know that? Yes, how to expreſs it better than you do. He would have ſaid, <hi>The Decree was of the Means and the End;</hi> and he would not have ſaid Willing the firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Means in order to a Will of the End, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the End to be brought about by the Means. <hi>Quod primum eſt in Intentione uttimum in Executione,</hi> as to our Conception. 4. You ſay, it puts nothing in preſent being. I ſay, it puts the Promiſe in <hi>an Eternal Being.</hi> And if you mean as to Created Beings, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, it puts them into a <hi>determinate Futurition.</hi> 5. You ſay, it barrs not God of his Government. No, it's not fit nor poſſible his own Pleaſure ſhould barr him of it, neither is it poſſible it ſhould barr him of what he would have; neither is he the more barred, becauſe you are pleaſed to find Fault; and it was his Pleaſure to govern as he willed to govern, and all the Connexion of Events, ſo as they come to paſs in a way of Neceſſity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56391:15"/> and Contingency. But he determined abſolutely, and nothing that falls out is contingent to him; for he judgeth not of Events as probable by Opinion, but as certain to his Knowledge; and therefore knows them, becauſe he willeth them to come to paſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Counſel and Purpoſe in himſelf.</p>

                        <hi>So if the Dr. had animadverted, that Chriſt's Sufferings were the Foundation of our Pardon, but not formally our Pardon: For them our Sins are forgiven whenever they be forgiven: Without them Sin can't be forgiven; and they were endured, that the Sins of all the Elect, when Believers, ſhould be forgiven.</hi>

                     <p>There's no doubt but the Dr. was ſo Learned and Wiſe, that he animadverted as much as you can tell him, and undoubtedly what was the main of his Judgment that he inſiſted upon, was not from Inanimad verſion, Ignorance or Miſtake. But you have found out, it ſeems, ſome ſubtile Diſtinction that he thought not of. You ſay he ſhould have ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings were the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Pardon.</hi> All that he ſaith and means, is, that our Sins were fundamentally pardoned in Chriſt. But your fundamentally is only a <hi>remote Cauſality,</hi> as Election is to Creation and Redemption; for that's the Foundation of both. If you had not intended ſo, why had you not ſaid the Material Cauſe, ſeeing you deny them to be the Formal; but you'l have them to be neither; and you ſay, <hi>For them our Sins are forgiven.</hi> Take heed how you touch there. Be careful you come not too near Chriſt. It's a tender Point; <hi>For them our Sins are forgiven.</hi> How! For them? For them as an End? Or how for them? As a ſatisfying Reaſon to the Law and offended Juſtice of God? Or only as a Benefit procured? For them remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or for them immediately? For them alone, or for them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with other things? All that we have at preſent of your Meaning of <hi>for them,</hi> is, that <hi>without them Sin cannot be forgiven.</hi> A poor <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> As a Judge gives Sentence upon a Malefactor, or acquits him: Why doth he ſentence or acquit him? For his coming to the Judgment-Hall? For, ſay I, unleſs the Judge had come to Court, the Priſoner could not have been condemned or acquitted. Chriſt is beholding to you for what you give to his Sufferings. But we ſhall ſee more of this hereafter.</p>

The Promiſe come after Chriſt's Sufferings, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between us and Chriſt's Sufferings?

But you'll have Chriſt to be provided as an Indefinite good Medicine, to ſtand in the Apothecaries Shop for ſome body or other when the Phyſician preſcribes it. Nay, it's not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſick Patient neither, that muſt have this Medicine; it's one that the Apothecary hath in a manner cured before: But there's ſome ugly Chronical Symptom or other remains, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt be ſent to, for. Before the Perſon be pardoned, he muſt be in a very ſound and ſafe Condition, I ſuppoſe you mean.</p>

                        <hi>There muſt be a work of the Spirit for Conformity to the Rule of the Promiſe in the Perſon to be pardoned, and a Judicial Act of Pardon by that Promiſe on the Perſon thus conformed to the Promiſe.</hi>

But God never intended to accept Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as a <hi>Foederal Condition</hi> of any Covenant whatever, nor no other Imperfect Obedience.

Repentance alſo is an included Duty, required in every Command of God upon a Suppoſal of a Tranſgreſſion; but that Repentance, or any Duties, are enjoyned as a Rule of Happineſs and Miſery, (if I underſtand your Rule aright, <hi>viz.</hi> A Foederal Condition giving Right as ſuch) ſince the Fall, I utterly deny; and the rather, becauſe any ſuch Duties ſuppoſe him a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as will be very eaſily made appear when need requires.</p>

                     <p>In your Sence it's taken in ſo large a Sence, as to make it Goſpel, is <hi>Nonſence.</hi> If it takes in all Moral Precepts as Foederal Conditions, (that's your Sence) then it ſets up the Old Law again, only new vamps it with ſome Additional Precepts: You have the Old Law you ſay, and a great deal more, the Precepts of Faith and Repentance, which are a Thouſand Times more hard to perform by Man in his Apoſtate State, than ever a hundred Laws would have been to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency. Now here is in your new Law brought in not only all the Precepts of the Old Law for Condition, but the difficult Task of a Blackamore's changing his Skin, and a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his Spots, before the Sinner hath the Benefit of the Promiſe, ſo much as in any taſte of pardoning Mercy, which you make (when he hath it) the <hi>Foederal Reward</hi> (for ſo it muſt be) <hi>of his Conformity to the Rule.</hi> 2. Chriſt our Redeemer gives Commands, and exerts a Kingly Power in Government of his Church, and hath Judgment committed to him; but theſe are not of the Goſpel Conditions of Life unto Sinners propounded in the Goſpel. God doth not require Obedience to the Laws of Chriſt in his Church as <hi>Foediral Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

It's true, all Judgment is committed to Chriſt as his Reward, but all that <hi>Judgment</hi> is not the Goſpel. <hi>viz.</hi> Whenever Chriſt is found in a way of Judgment, to deſtroy, not to ſave: So the Word Preached, where it proves a Savour unto Death, it's not Goſpel to ſuch in the Event. 4. You ſay, they are the Laws of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as well as the Laws of a Creator. It's true, Chriſt is Creator: But is the Goſpel a Revival of his Law as Creator, in a way of Redemption?

                     <p>The Change you pretend to therefore is not in the Sanction, but in the Condition; the preceptive part, or the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it required, your Sanction ſtill remains of Life or Death, as in the firſt Covenant of Works. But ſee how well your Scheme hangs together. You ſay there's nothing abated in the Rule of Sin and Duty. 1. I never thought God gave a Rule of Sin; therefore that's mighty improper; but let it be a Rule to judge of Sin by. 2. You ſay, There's nothing abated of the Rule of Sin and Duty, therefore nothing abated in the conditionary preceptive part of the Law: And there can be nothing abated in the Sanction, it muſt be Life or Death, <hi>Ergo,</hi> There's the ſame Law ſtill, and we muſt be ſaved by the Covenant of Works, or not at all. But, 3. The Reaſon you give of changing the Sanction, is, becauſe the Bleſſings
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56391:17"/> are promiſed to <hi>lower Degrees</hi> of Duty. This, as I ſaid, is no Change in the Promiſe, but in the Condition; and then ſee how you contradict your ſelf in the ſame Breath. You ſay, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abated in the Rule, and yet lower Degrees of Duty admitted. How can theſe Lower Degrees be admitted, but by the Rule of the preceptive part? For the Degrees of Duty required are according to God's Commands; and he requires in a Law Duty anſwering the Perfection of the Precept.</p>

                     <p>This is not Sence as expreſs'd: But I take your Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 1. Death was threatned in the Covenant of Works, but it ſpake not of a continuance in that State, with any ſuch Barr to a Bleſſing, as ſhould hinder God from the ſaving of Sinners: But you own that Barr might be removed, and was; but your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant puts as great a Barr as that, That if Men perform not the Condition, they muſt continue in the ſtate of Death notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that Chriſt hath done to remove the Barr from the Old Covenant. For their Concernment (in your Sence) is not now for a Righteouſneſs to anſwer that, but to anſwer the New Law, which lays them under Life or Death. 2. Is the Condition the ſame, and more? And the Sanction the ſame? How is it poſſible it ſhould not threaten Death to every Degree of Sin? 3. It ſeems our Salvation is according to the Degree of Sin. We muſt know what Sins are of ſuch a Degree, as that they are pardonable; what Venial, and what Mortal; and if Law and Goſpel are diſtinguiſhed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Sin, Goſpel lies in Sin, not Grace it ſeems; for if it be from the Degree of Sin that we are ſaved, then not from the Blood of Chriſt which taketh away all Sin. 4. Doth God's Law admit of Sin in any Degree, then I ſay as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is the Law Sin?</hi> To admit of Sin into Law is Sin. No; the Law is Holy, Juſt and Good, and the Promiſe doth not make void the Law, by abating one Jot or Tittle of it, but eſtabliſheth the Law: Therefore the Law cannot admit of Sin.</p>

                     <p>So the Covenant of Redemption is not the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but neither is there any Claim to be made by it, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that interpoſeth between the Second Covenant and us. We are not entitled at all to this new Covenant-Bleſſing by Chriſt, but by our own Obediance (you mean) in performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Covenant, you ſay. How? To defend from the Old Law Proſecution, that there may be no Interruption: but our New Law may have quiet in allowance of our Imperfect Obedience. Chriſt Mediator with you is but as the Angel that defended Paradice; ſo Chriſt ſtands and defends the New Law, that no exception may be taken at its proceeding in Juſtification by Imperfect Obedience. This is to make the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin, to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice to procure an imperfect Righteouſneſs for a Covenant Condition: For in all Imperfections of Obedience there's a mixture of Sin. And is not this to make Sin good in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And implicitly to aſſert, it can do us no hurt in the lower
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56391:19"/> Degree, it coming in as an Allay to the ſtrictneſs of the Covenant of Works: There's a neceſſity of it as to the very formal Nature of it in the Condition: For otherwiſe it would be a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and then exclude us from all Bleſſedneſs, as you ſay.</p>

Take your way of Expreſſion in what Sence you pleaſe, it's ſo Unſcholar-like, that a School-boy ſhould be whipt for it. 2. I tell you, the Goſpel hath no Law Sanction at all of its own, but it only eſtabliſheth the Sanction of the Law, by way of Promiſe to all ſaved ones; Chriſt is the End of the Law to them; and as to thoſe that are not ſaved, the Law takes it's Courſe upon them; they come not under the Efficacy of the Goſpel at all. 3. In the whole you have ſaid, you have affirmed the Goſpel to be a Covenant of Works, as it's your uſual manner.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. I would fain know whether the Goſpel offers not Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don unto unbelieving and impenitent Sinners? Not that they ſhould continue unbelieving and impenitent, but that they ſhould believe and repent. For the Promiſe of the Goſpel is an Offer and Tender of Forgiveneſs unto Sinners; and it's preached to them as ſuch, to perſwade and encourage them to believe; and whether this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be not before Faith, to work it? if not, the Sinner hath no ground to believe: For where there's no Promiſe, there's no ground to believe. 2. If it declare a Barr to all preſent impenitent ones and Rejecters of Chriſt, it is preached in vain; for all are ſo till they receive Chriſt by Faith. 3. Whether Faith and Repentance be not included in the Promiſe of the Goſpel? I ſay, They are: All Gifts of Grace belong to the Promiſe of Grace; but Faith and Repentance are Gifts of Grace: T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Scripture is expreſs in it. Now then I argue, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Faith and Repentance belong to the Promiſe, to the ſame Promiſe that gives forth Pardon, and therefore are no Conditions; they are Benefits, they are Life in Chriſt, and there's none can have them but ſuch as are in Chriſt: And therefore Pardon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56391:19"/> is not promiſed to Faith and Repentance, as things diſtinct from the Promiſe; but Pardon is promiſed together with Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Sinner. The Spirit of God only gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they are to go together. Pardon is rather the Connditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith and Repentance, and much more, having a cauſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thereunto, then Faith and Repentance of Pardon. 2. The Goſpel doth not fix Faith and Repentantance as Conditions of Pardon in your Sence, <hi>i. e.</hi> Working Conditions to entitle us to Chriſt; for we are pardoned and juſtified freely; and though there be Faith and Repentance upon giving forth of Pardon, yet Faith, Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins are given in the ſame Promiſe to the Ungodly, to Perſons that were even till now Impenitent Rejecters of Chriſt. 3. But you go on with your Myſtery. Firſt, The Sinner muſt be qualified with Faith and Repentance, before he is reconciled to God in a way of Pardon; and when he hath that, he is to come on upon another Covenant for poſſeſſing of Heaven. Now there muſt be ſincere Holineſs and Perſeverance to qualifie him for Heaven: The Promiſe of Heaven, its upon other Conditions. What a Sad Caſe is a poor Sinner in, if he make a ſhift to ſcramble by his imperfect Conditions into Covenant! He is like every Day to be turned out again: And when he hath done the beſt he can; yet he muſt never believe that he ſhall go to Heaven till he lies a dying. It were happy for him to be knock'd on the Head when he is in a good Frame, leſt he ſhould loſe all again, and put to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to go through all his imperfect, ſincere, perſevering, moral Righteouſneſs, believing he knows not what. For if he falls into Sin, he muſt conclude his Perſeverance is at an end; you muſt enform us what Degrees of Sin in our imperfect Obedience may be admitted before we conclude that our Perſeverance is at an end; and then, though you ſay Happineſs will come upon Perſeverance, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Holineſs, I ſuppoſe, then perfect Holineſs is that which qualifies us for perfect Happineſs, and is the Condition of it: Therefore we muſt arrive at it in this Life, that ſo we may have the Condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Promiſe.

                     <p>Now we come to the Whirligig, that is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Scheme. 1. We would know whether there be any difference between Conformity to a Rule and Precept in a Law? And, 2. What is the Rule of the Promiſe? Is it not with you the Precept? If it be not, how is Conformity to it Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? 3. The Promiſe is not properly a Precept as ſuch, tho'
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56391:20"/> the Goſpel-Promiſe is the Ground and Reaſon of all Goſpel-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; but not Precepts of Promiſes: And how can any Man conform to the Precept in your Sence, and not expect and have from thence the Uſe of the Benefits? Yea, and not look upon it as Federally following therefrom. 4. I would fain know what gave the Uſe of the Benefit in the Covenant of Works? For you ſay, this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Rules of Happineſs and Miſery in the ſame manner. Was not the Uſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Faederal Holineſs as to Happineſs from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Precept? Where was the Rule of the Promiſe there? Either it muſt be in the Precept, or the Promiſe it ſelf, or in the Connexion of Promiſe and Precept. Have I hit it now? It's ſure, the Connexion is the Rule of the Promiſe. Now how is that a Rule of the Promiſe, but in Conformity to the Precept? and then it's Conformity to the Rule of Precept and not of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: Or is it poſſible to come with a Conformity to the Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Precept and Promiſe? Now all the Intricate Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue is only to tell us in the Clouds, that Faith applying the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not juſtifie us, but as it is a working Condition to which the Promiſe is annexed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Yes, it follows, our applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on it, would no more juſtifie us, than our ſincere Holineſs would ſave us, were it not for this Goſpel-Promiſe, That God will juſtifie for Chriſt's ſake all thoſe that believe.</hi>

                     <p>The Buſineſs here that is the Kernel of this Nut, is, that Faith doth not Juſtifie us by applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in the Promiſe, by vertue of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs it ſelf imputed, but by its own Vertue, as being a Righteouſneſs it ſelf, whereby it anſwers the Promiſe as a Condition upon which it is made. As for Faith's receiving Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, it ſerves thereby to barr the Old Law: But Chriſt's Righteouſneſs hath nothing to do here; it's our own Faith and Repentance is the Righteouſneſs in their Conformity to the Rule of the Promiſe; and that's Latin for the New Law. Here are great Myſteries more than <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood, and all the Apoſtles, any other than to reckon them another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and vain talking. And truly, as for your comparing Chriſt and Holineſs in the matter of Juſtification under the Umbrage of your Invented Rule of Promiſe, is perfect Stuff: It amounts but to this at beſt, That if God had not promiſed Juſtification, there had been none at all, neither by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, nor by ours. But how came this Promiſe? Do you not ſay, Chriſt purchaſed it as an conditional Grant?</p>

                        <hi>Hence by Goſpel Grace there's a great difference between im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Faith and utter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief; between ſincere Holineſs, and formal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56391:20"/> Profaneneſs or Wickedneſs; true Love to God and prevailing Enmity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By the Law of Works nothing was Holy but what was perfectly ſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But read the Bible, if thou doubteſt whether there is not a true Faith, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Love, &amp;c. which be ſhort of Perfection.</hi>

                     <speaker>Antinom.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought we ſhould have had a greater Inſtance of the Grace of God, than in giving us a worſe <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant than <hi>Adam</hi> had. You ſhould have told us what Perfection here you mean; I ſuppoſe it muſt be only of Parts, that it may be a Goſpel <hi>Foederal Condition,</hi> which muſt be imperfect; and it muſt be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Sin, or elſe it will not anſwer the Rule of the Promiſe. Now you will not allow it muſt anſwer the Rule of the Precept, for there's nothing abated of it; but it muſt chop in between the Precept and Promiſe as the Goſpel Condition in a way of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that without Sin our Holineſs is nothing Foederally: We muſt take heed it become not perfect Holineſs; for if once it comes to that, we fall under the Law of Works: This were to begin in the Spirit of Imperfection, and end in the Fleſh of Perfect Holineſs. And this is the ſad Condition of the Saints in Heaven, that they are fallen under the Covenant of Works. Again, you do here not a little inſinuate what I know lies in your Breaſt, that there is no ſpecifick difference between Grace and meer moral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; and it appears ſo upon all your Hypotheſes. For you declare, there ought to be ſuch and ſuch Qualifications to entitle a Man to the Promiſe of Grace, or Grace in the Promiſe, before he hath the Promiſe. And as to your Exhortation to the reading of the Bible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt tell you, I have read the Bible ſeveral times, and hope to read it, and meditate on the Word of Grace contained therein, as long as I live. But if that be the true Doctrine of the Goſpel which you have delivered in this Book, I am utterly at a loſs for my Salvation, which I would be loth to be now at laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many Years Satisfaction: And let the World take notice, that I do believe your Goſpel to be another Goſpel, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and accurſeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>

                     <p>This is plainly as much as to ſay, God diſpenſeth the Goſpel-Promiſe Judicially in the ſame way as a Law of Works. He looks whether or no we have fully performed the Conditions; and upon finding of them, he judicially gives the Promiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> In a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56391:21"/> way of Reward to the Works performed: Whether they be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or Imperfect, it's no matter, the Reward is of Debt, and not of Grace: And in this way Pardon is given upon Imperfect Faith and Repentance: And thus Heaven is given Judicially for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Holineſs. Here's not a bit of Enquiry whether they have Chriſt or no, he is a Cypher in the matter of our Salvation. No Papiſt can utter more groſs Divinity. But this is a ſtrange way of Diſpenſation of Goſpel-Benefits: Firſt to determine a Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Rule of the Benefit. As for Example, In diſpenſing Faith, for that's a Promiſe; God determins judicially, a Man hath a Conformity to the Rule before Faith. Again, Is Forgiveneſs a judicial declaring a Man hath true Faith? Or doth this judicial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration go before Pardon and Juſtification? If ſo, a Man hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true Faith before he is juſtified and pardoned, what abſurd Conſequences will follow thereupon? And what can this be but a declared Judgment that he is <hi>de Congruo,</hi> deſerving Pardon? And I think, <hi>ex Condigno</hi> too before he is pardoned; and upon the ſame Terms are the perſevering Saints at laſt admitted to Glory.</p>

We have briefly ſhewed, as you have given occaſion, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as ſuch, is no Law, and hath not a Sanctio, it's wholly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Life, and the Performance of the Promiſe doth not depend upon any thing a Sinner can do as a Foederal Condition. I ſhall ſhew fully hereafter, that there is no ground from that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. nor that of <hi>James</hi> 1. to conclude the Goſpel to be a Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Duty for a Condition with a Sanction of Threats upon the Non-performance, or Promiſes as Rewards upon the Performance, whether the Condition be Perfect of Imperfect Obedience. You make the Sincerity of Grace and Holineſs to be this Condition, and you call it the Rule of the Promiſe, (which you ſay is not the Precept neither) neither is it the Promiſe, but a Rule that is neither Precept or Promiſe. So what your Rule is, he is wiſe that knows. And you ſay this Rule makes Sincerity neceſſary in the Diſcription of the Perſon: So the Rule of the Promiſe deſcribes a Perſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore makes him not, but tells us he muſt be ſincere before he hath any thing to do with the Promiſe. From whence hath he this Sincerity deſcribed? From Law or Goſpel? From God or himſelf? If from God, then by way of Grace and Gift, and ſo through the Promiſe. If of our ſelves, it's Droſs: They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, and therefore much leſs perform ſuch a Duty, for which God will give the promiſed Benefits.</p>

                        <hi>And diſſwading Men from thoſe things which the Goſpel threatens ſhall hinder their Intereſt in all, or any of their Benefits, with an Aggravation of their Miſery if they be final Rejecters of Grace.</hi>

                     <p>Whatever befalls Sinners retaining their ſinful ſtate, and rejecting Grace, is from the Law, and not from the Goſpel. To talk of a Goſpel-Threat, is a Catechreſis at beſt, and nothing elſe can ſave it from being a Bull. But what are thoſe that will hinder a Sinner from the Benefit of being turned from Darkneſs to Light? This I can ſuppoſe is the Non-improvement of the Grace (which you take every one to have) which either hinders or makes that they are not converted.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56391:26"/> the 39 Articles, ſhould ſo palpably and openly go about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſome Foundation-Principles therein contained, as <q>Imputed Righteouſneſs, and Juſtification only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, and not for our own Works and Deſervings, and that we are juſtified by Faith only.</q> 
                        <hi>Article</hi> 11. And that Principle aſſerted in the 13th, <q>That Works done before the Grace of Chriſt, and the Inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſing to God, foraſmuch as they ſpring not from Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> The Contrary Doctrine to both theſe Articles (under whatever Evaſions and Prevarications you ſeem to abſcond your ſelf) you make the great Buſineſs of your Book not only to inſinuate, but manifeſtly enough to aſſert and endeavour to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In that it appears to be your Deſign to blaſt the whole Doctrine of <hi>Imputation,</hi> (whatever you pretend,) both of Imputation of <hi>our Sins</hi> to Chriſt, and of the Imputation of <hi>his Righteouſneſs</hi> unto us. 2. That you make it your great Buſineſs to ſet up and eſtabliſh a Covenant of Works, boldly aſſerting the Goſpel to be a Law with Sanction of Rewards and Puniſhments, and that the conditional part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are Imperfect Works, and that we are juſtified by thoſe Works <hi>as a Subordinate</hi> Righteouſneſs to the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, and that <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf is concerned therein but as an Act, in the ſame manner as Repentance and other parts of imperfect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, tho in a little kind of Precedency. Your Book alſo is full of many other Errors, that have dependence on theſe Capital Ones, which for Brevity ſake I will not now rehearſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your many Inconſiſtencies, Contradictions, Equivocations, Falſe Inſinuations, illiterate, abſurd and unſound Expreſſions, that render your Book very Offenſive to ſound and ſolid Minds.</p>

                  <p>OBſerve the following Debate is by may of Dialogue, the Rule of which is, that each Interlocutor is to be allowed to ſpeak his own Sentiments, and of ſuch as he repreſents, and therewith to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what Light and Evidence may be had to evince the Truth of what is offered, and defend it from the Charge of Error, under whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination he ſtands, thereby truly or falſly called. Here is no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pole, or vouch for Truth, or againſt Error, to impoſe upon the Faith of the Reader, but he is left to take or leave as he finds ſufficient ground to be perſwaded in his own mind from what is offered by either of the Dialogiſts.</p>
                  <p>If any one would know (among any Variety of Apprehenſions that he may ſometimes find concerning matters in Debate) what the Author's Opinion is, he would not have it weigh with any one, ſo as to carry a Bias in his Judgment, and therefore doth rather chooſe modeſtly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to Argue than to Determine, allowing each Dialogist his full Scope: But for Satisfaction to the more earneſt Enquirer, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he doth acknowledge the Scriptures to be the Word of God, the perfect and only Rule of Faith and Practice, and acceunts him ſound who owns the Doctrinal part of thoſe, commonly called, <hi>The Articles of the Church of</hi> England, the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> Shorter and larger, compiled by the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at <hi>Weſtminiſter,</hi> and the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> agreed on in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> to be agreenble to the ſaid Rule, according to their Genuine Sence and Meaning. And as to his Deſign, it was not what the <hi>Comeedian</hi> ſaith his was, <hi>Quum primum animum ad ſcribendum appulit, id ſibi negotii credidit ſolum dari, Populo ut placerent quas feciſſet fabulas.</hi> Which he ſaith fell out much otherwiſe than he expected, <hi>Verum alitèr evinire multò intelligit.</hi> How little Cauſe hath he then to be ſurprized, whom the Doctrine of Chriſtianity hath taught better things; viz. That if he <hi>pleaſe Men,</hi> or ſeek ſo to do, he ſhould <hi>not be the Servant of
<pb facs="tcp:56391:29"/> Chriſt;</hi> and that he is not <hi>Judged at Man's Day,</hi> but <hi>He that Judgeth him is the Lord:</hi> His Comfort is that the Cauſe is good, whatever Infirmity may accompany the Management.</p>

Whereupon there was much Whiſpering in the Company upon the appearance of this new old Face, one ſaying one thing of him, and another another; but in the mean time Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> being not yet come, Mr. <hi>Calviniſt</hi> takes Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> into a Withdrawing Room, and thus he begins with him.</p>

                           <hi>I have this Errour to charge Mr.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. <hi>with, viz.</hi> That he ſaith <hi>the Elect are at no time of their Lives under the Wrath of God, nor are they ſubject to Condemnation, if they ſhould die before they ſhould believe; yea, when they are under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Sin, and in the practice of the greateſt Villanies, they are as much the Sons of God, and Juſtified, as the Saints in Glory. D. W.</hi> p. 1. This I prove from Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> p. 363, 364.</p>

                        <p>He ſaith, <q>It's thought by ſome, that in Caſe ſuch a Perſon ſhould die before God call him to Grace, and give to him to believe, that Perſon had been Damned.</q> But that is a vain Suppoſition, for it were to ſuppoſe a Man Elected and not Elected; a Man Elected to the End and not to the Means, or that the Sins of the Elect are laid upon Chriſt, and the Elect not ſecured thereby from Condemnation. And he ſaith therefore, <q>That the Lord hath no more to lay to the Charge of an Elect Perſon [conſidered as ſuch] than to the Saints in Glory; his reaſon is, becauſe his Sins are laid on Chriſt; and tho' the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remain yet Unregenerate, and in the heighth of Iniquity, yet God hath no more to lay to his Charge than to a Believer, or to a Saint in Glory.</q> By this he means there is ſo full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and provſion made for all the Elect, that as to Chriſts bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Sins, and ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, there is as much already done by Chriſt as ever ſhall in reſpect of ſatisfaction; <hi>for he was once offered to bear the Sins of many, Heb.</hi> 9.28. And if the Sins of the Elect were born by Chriſt, they were ſatisfied for, and in reſpect of Divine Eſſential Juſtice there can be nothing laid to their Charge, ſo as to affect them with a ſtroak of Vindicative Juſtice; thoſe that are Elected are Redeemed by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6. And when the Spirit of God ſpeaks of an Elect Perſon, it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56391:31"/> always ſpeaks of him as ſecure in his Perſon from Wrath and Condemnation, as to the real Execution of the ſentence of the Law upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>It's one thing to ſay an Elect Perſon is free from Condemnation as ſuch, and another thing to ſay a Sinner is thus freed from it. He ſaith not, that if a Man die under the dominion of Sin, or the practice of the greateſt Villanies, he ſhall be ſaved; that's a falſe Charge. <hi>Paul</hi> as an Elect Veſſel, was by vertue of Election and Redemption ſecured from Condemnation in Execution of the Law Sentence upon him, all the time of his Unregeneracy; neither could a Charge be laid againſt him that could cut off his Perſon from the Benefits deſigned for him in Election, or prepared and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in Redemption. See what Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> ſaith to this Charge, <hi>p.</hi> 637.</p>

                        <p>That Men are not under the Sence of the Law, and by the ſtate of Nature under Wrath, he doth not ſay, and <hi>in foro Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi> when the Law ſpeaks to him as under it, for he ſaith, p. 359, 360. <q>There's a laying Sin on Chriſt, 1. By way of Obligation, ſo he bore the Sins of the Elect [before he ſuffered actually] from all Eternity, and by virtue thereof the Elect were juſtify'd before Chriſt came [as the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.] 2. By way of Execution, and this was his Real bearing, the other was Vertual; but there's a third, which is the Lords laying Iniquity on Chriſt by way of Application. <hi>i. e.</hi> When it is that the Lord doth ſingle out this or that particular Perſon, and lay his Iniquities on Chriſt. Concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in general, they were in the Eye of God before they had a Real Exiſtence. So all their Iniquities were laid on Chriſt from Eternity, but it muſt needs be granted that a particular Application of this Grace to Perſons muſt be in time, before a Perſon is in being there cannot be a Perſonal Application of the Grace of God; God cannot apply his Grace to nothing.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>P. 361. <q>Know alſo that this Application is double, there's Gods Application and Mans; Gods Application is when he himſelf doth ſay, he loves ſuch a Perſon. Man's Application is, when God gives to Men to Believe, and by this Act of believing to be perſwaded and reſolved that God hath done it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>He diſtinguiſheth likewiſe, and ſaith, <q>God lays the Iniquity of every Elect Perſon two ways, in reſpect of the Application of this Grace.</q> 1. <hi>Secretly.</hi> 2 <hi>Manifeſtly.</hi> As to ſecret applying, he inſtances in God's Declaration of his Love to <hi>Jacob, Rom.</hi> 9. and ſaith,
<q>
                              <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56391:31"/>We have here, (<hi>p.</hi> 362.) the Lord's declaring himſelf perſonally and judicially unto the one whom he loved, <hi>Jacob;</hi> there was a Love to him from Eternity in the Election of Grace; but till there was a ſingle Individual Perſon, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Lord did not ſay, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now he concludes, <q>That this ſecret Application of the Grace of laying Sins on Chriſt, is at the very inſtant of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons having a Being in the World, then God doth appropriate this Grace to an Elect Perſon; and therefore in the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Eſtate of ſuch a Perſon, in the Exceſs of Riot, [he is ſecured from the Judicial Charge of Sin, from Vindicative Juſtice.] There's great diverſity of Judgment about the time of applying this Grace, (ſaith he.) Some ſay it's at Baptiſm, ſome ſay at firſt Converſion, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 364. It's true, an Elect perſon not called, is never able to know individually of himſelf, that he is ſuch an one that God hath nothing to charge upon him, becauſe till Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God gives not unto Perſons to Believe: And it's only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is the Evidence of things not ſeen; and this he calls the Application of pardoning Grace by way of manifeſtation.</q> Thus I have given you the Summ of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Opinion in this matter.</p>

                        <speaker>Calvin.</speaker>
                        <p>I perceive then his Opinion is, that, 1. In General, That by Electing and Redeeming Love the Elect are ſecured from the Stroak of Vindicative Juſtice, and God hath nothing to lay to their Charge, having accepted the Satisfaction of Chriſt on their behalf. 2. That the Application of this Love to a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in time, as to God's Sentence concerning him, and as to ſome Fruits of this Love from his firſt having a Being; as ſuppoſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing of him as a choſen Veſſel, as he did <hi>Jacob</hi> from <hi>Eſau:</hi> As he ſeparated <hi>Paul</hi> to the Deſigns of electing Love, as to prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, yea, and providential Grace, to bring ſuch a Perſon, it may be, under the Secret Effects of the Promiſe, and the means of Grace. 3. He ſaith, The manifeſt Application is, when God gives to Believe: So that notwithſtanding all the Security he hath by Election, Redemption, and ſecret Application, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, but in a ſtate of Death, and under the Law-Sentence <hi>in Foro Conſcientiae,</hi> and by Nature born a Child of Wrath, and ſo in <hi>Foro Mundi.</hi> Hence, that he knows nothing of all this, ſpoken of an Elect Perſon, any more than a Reprobate doth, till he doth believe: I think this is Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Full Sence, and therefore I think, Mr. <hi>Neonomian,</hi> you are too partial in your Repreſentation of the Doctor; you take thoſe Expreſſions only that may render him odious, and leave out the Grounds and Reaſons thereof. As
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56391:32"/> to that Opinion of his concerning God's ſecret paſſing over his Love to the Elect Perſons ſo long before they believe. What if he be ſingular therein, yet there may be more in it than you or I can tell, ſeeing it is manifeſt that it hath been ſo in ſeveral that have lived to be Adult; and I doubt not but it is ſo daily as to Elect Infants that die in Infancy. And I muſt tell you, if you deny this Covenant of Grace to belong to the Infants of believing Parents, as it is claimed by vertue of a Goſpel-Promiſe, you can have little Ground to plead for Infant-Baptiſm, which is a Sign and Seal of Forgiveneſs of Sins in ſome Goſpel-Sence or other. But I leave that Point now; and I muſt tell you, that there is no doubt but that there is a ſecret paſſing over of the Grace of God in Chriſt to every Elect Perſon, before he can put forth anyone Vital Act.</p>

                        <p>The Doctor in this point, for ought I know, affirms and denies but as you do. He ſaith, a Sinner in reſpect of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Eſtate is under the Law-Sentence, and dead in Sin and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. He will not deny this, but that an Elect Perſon as ſuch, hath a hidden Relation, Standing and Right, not only in reſpect of Election, Satisfaction and Procurement, but a ſecret paſſing over of Grace. So that to be a Child of Wrath in regard of the Law-Sentence, and a Child of Mercy, are not <hi>contradicentia;</hi> they may be predicated of the ſame Subject in divers reſpects: A Man may be a Child of Wrath in one reſpect, and of Mercy in another. A Man may be poor in one reſpect, and rich in another, as the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> condemned in one reſpect, and ſecured from it in another. Wrath is underſtood two ways in Scripture. 1. For the Sentence of the Law, that all the World is under, as having ſinned, and come ſhort of the Righteouſneſs of God. 2. For the real Execution of the Sentence of the Law by Eſſential Vindicative Juſtice: This the Elect are abundantly freed from, and the Wrath of God ſhall never fall upon them as ſuch.</p>

                        <p>Yes, a ſecret and hidden Right, but true and certain, though not Poſſeſſion or Claim, till Grace embraceth them, and this Grace manifeſted to them. A Child that hath a good Right to an Inheritance may be taken Captive in Infancy, and remain in <hi>Algiers</hi> a Slave many Years, and never know of any Eſtate belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: But upon his return to his Native Country, finds by Writings and Court-Rolls that he hath had Right all this while, though kept out of Poſſeſſion, and knew no Ground of a Claim. A Man may be Heir to a Crown, and yet during the King's Life be no King; yea, it may be, out in Rebellion againſt his Father many Years, and yet come to poſſeſs the Crown upon his previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Right. A Man may have a good Right to an Eſtate in one Court where it is enrolled, whenas another Court knows nothing of it. Every Elect Perſon is enrolled by Name in God's Book of Election, and the Lamb's Book of Redemption, while there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this to be ſound <hi>in Foro Conſcientiae,</hi> nor <hi>in Foro Mundi.</hi> And your own Aſſertion at firſt cuts you off from all Pleas to the contrary.

Though I ſay not, that it's ſo with every one, but apprehend the Spirit of God hath theſe things to inſtruct us thereby, that Juſtification of a Sinner before God is not for the Act of Faith, or Goſpel-Obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> was juſtified before either. 2. That the Children of Believing Parents dying in Infancy may be juſtified and ſaved. 3. That a believing Parent hath Promiſe Ground to baptize his Child, and exerciſe Faith, that his Child is embraced in the Arms of Free Grace, to work upon it how, and when, and in what manner he pleaſeth; and though he can't be active therein, yet he may be paſſive. This we pray for, and in praying believe: God ſaying, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi> I am not for Baptiſmal Regeneration, nor Baptiſmal Juſtification: Though there is ſomething Analogous to it, and therefore a kind of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in <hi>Foro Eccleſiae,</hi> it being a ſignificant Seal of it, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was called the Covenant: And therefore if there be any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56391:35"/> ſecret Application of the Grace of Election and Redemption ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying that Inſtitution of Chriſt, or coming before or after, neither we nor our Children ſhall be ever the worſe for it. And therefore let us not banter and condemn ſuch as have higher Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Secret Workings of Grace before we are aware of of it. I am ſure many Divines that you would not call <hi>Antinomians,</hi> have defended Infant Baptiſm upon this Notion, That Infants are capable of the Habit of Saving Faith. And if ſo, I am ſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Notion, they muſt be Juſtified, becauſe they have the qualifying Condition: For a Habit is a Quality, and a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Rule of the Promiſe, (as you phraſe it) and therefore muſt Juſtifie as ſuch.</p>

                        <p>There's a Difference between an Heir and Adoption. If you know there is an Elect Perſon in the Womb, as <hi>Rebecka</hi> did, he is a more ſure Heir to Heaven than ever any great Man's Son was to an outward Eſtate. And as to Adoption, that may not be till ſome time after: For that is the Grace of Sonſhip. It's one thing to be a Son, and another to have the Grace of Sonſhip. And is the call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the Sons of God, manifeſtly taking them into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and endowing them with the Priviledges of the Sons of God? The Relation of an Heir, and the ſtate of Adoption, admit of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Conſiderations. The State of Adoption, is the grown ſtate of an Elect Perſon; he is put into Poſſeſſion of the Eſtate, and all Priviledges, ſit together with Chriſt in Heavenly Places as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir. And thus we are the <hi>Children of God by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.26. <hi>The Spirit bearing Witneſs with our Spirit that we are the Children of God, and ſo Heirs</hi> ex abundanti, <hi>Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17.</p>

                           <q>What though we are by Nature Children of Wrath, doth it follow that we may not be otherwiſe by Grace; the ſtate of Wrath goes firſt in order of Nature, and whether in order of time alſo is not worth our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting; but may not a ſtate of Grace immediately ſucceed? <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> was Sanctified in the Womb, and <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> and the Infants that Chriſt Bleſſed were all by Nature Children of Wrath, and yet by Grace were in a better ſtate. As they come from old <hi>Adam</hi> they are Children of VVrath, but as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Grace procured by the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they are not Children of wrath. If a Prince ſhould Entail ſome Honours upon all your Children; you might well ſay by Nature, or as they were your Children, they were not Honourable or Noble, and yet by the Favour of the Prince they might be all Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the VVomb.

                           <q>It is no Extraordinary thing which Chriſt ſpeaks concerning Infants, when he ſaith, <hi>Except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom of God as little Children, &amp;c.</hi> and they cannot receive it without Chriſt, nor without Faith in Chriſt, and yet received not Chriſt nor Faith by their own immediate Hearing of the Word; and for the ſecond thing which you make Eſſential to Union with Chriſt, (<hi>viz.</hi> a Heart fitly diſpoſed to apprehend and receive Chriſt,) be not unwilling to underſtand that which is Truth. The Heart is fitly diſpoſed by Faith to apprehend or apply Chriſt, when Faith is begotten in the Heart; for by this Gift of Faith begotten in us, Chriſt apprehends us, and by the ſame Gift of Faith the Heart is fitly diſpoſed to apprehend Chriſt even in Infants; for when Faith is wrought in Infants, the Heart is quickned with Spiritual Life, and made a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Veſſel to receive Chriſt, which reception of Chriſt though it be paſſive, yet it is all one with Regeneration, (as Dr. <hi>Ameſ.

                        <p>I ſhall ſhew you by comparing his Charge and Proof together, how fallaciouſly he deals with you, and Invidiouſly with Dr. <hi>C.</hi> He ſaith, I ſaid God laid all the very Sins of the Elect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, he ſhould have added, by <hi>Imputation,</hi> for his Proof runs thus, <hi>Our Sins ſo became Chriſts, that he ſtood the Sinner in our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56391:37"/> ſtead, and we diſcharged:</hi> Now I pray is it to become the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Actor, when I ſtand in the ſtead of another Perſon that did it. The Proof makes his Charge falſe, the very Evidence he brings is enough for my Defence againſt his Charge; and when he brings theſe words of mine [to prove, that I hold Chriſt became the real Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] if thou beeſt a Thief, Murderer, Lyar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe Tranſgreſſions (if thou haſt part in the Lord) become Actually the Tranſgreſſions of Chriſt, he ſhould have told you how I explain'd my ſelf; and he knows I mean no otherwiſe than what can be Chriſts by Actual Imputation. Here's a Great Sputter of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Actual,</hi> and <hi>very Sins, &amp;c.</hi> He might as well if he had dealt candidly, told you all my meaning, and not perverted it to ſerve his own Reproachful Tongue.

                        <p>
                           <q>This Iniquity was really laid upon Chriſt; Chriſt was as really the Bearer of the Sins of Gods People,<note place="margin">D. C. p. <hi>373.</hi>
                              </note> as a Surety is really the Debtor when he willingly puts himſelf into the Room of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Debtor. Inſomuch that God cannot expect the Debt any where but of Chriſt. Chriſt gives the Bond, and by giving the Bond makes himſelf the Debtor. God accepts of this, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it diſchargeth the poor Sinners themſelves, and if he will have payment he muſt have it where himſelf hath laid the Debt. God was in Chriſt Reconciling the World unto himſelf, not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Treſpaſſes to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. <hi>verſ.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Sir you have the great prodigious Errour that Mr. <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> chargeth me to be guilty of. As the Surety gives Bond for the very Debt of the Principal to a Farthing, the very Debt of this or that Party by Name, Living in ſuch a Place, of ſuch a Calling, for a Debt contracted at ſuch a time. <q>So that it's that Debt, not another that he contracted at another time, or the Debt of another Man, but the Debt ſo and ſo circumſtantiated, deſcribed and ſubſcribed by the Debtors own Hand. A Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enters into the ſame Bond, changing only the Names.<note place="margin">D. C. p. <hi>330.</hi>
                              </note> Sin is called our Debts by Chriſt himſelf who is our Surety. Did he not bear our very Debts? He that bare our very Debts, bare our very Sins; but Chriſt bare our very Debts; and now for me to pay the very Debts of a Debtor that is become Bankrupt, and ſpent his Eſtate upon Luxury, is it to become the Luxurious Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Debt.</q>

But you muſt blot out, <hi>for Sin,</hi> then it's not Puniſhment; for if the Law inflict Suffering it's <hi>for Sin;</hi> and if for Sin, it's Puniſhment; and if a Puniſhment, Sin was in ſome ſenſe or other ſound upon him, or elſe the Law wronged him in inflicting Sufferings on him. <q>Now when I ſay it is Iniquity it ſelf that the Lord hath laid on Chriſt,<note place="margin">D.

                              </note> I mean as the Prophet doth, it is the <hi>fault of</hi> the Tranſgreſſion it ſelf; and to ſpeak more fully, that erring and ſtraying like Sheep, that very erring, ſtraying and tranſgreſſing, is paſſed off from them, and is laid upon Chriſt, [<hi>viz.</hi> by Imputation.] To ſpeak it more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Haſt thou been an Idolater, Blaſphemer, Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If thou haſt a part in Chriſt, they become Actually the Tranſgreſſions of Chriſt,<note place="margin">D.

                              </note> [by Imputation,] and ſo ceaſe to be thine, —for he was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Tranſgreſſors.

He was made Sin for us;</hi> there's a great deal of difference between being made Sin and a Sinner, the Expreſſion in the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract</hi> going beyond the <hi>Concrete.</hi> I know the word may be ſpoke Hyperbolically; not that Chriſt ſimply could be made Sin, not that his Eſſence could be turned into Sin, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles meaning was, that no Tranſgreſſor in the World was ſuch a Tranſgreſſor as Chriſt was. But ſtill he was a Tranſgreſſor, as our Tranſgreſſions were laid upon him; not that he was the Actor of any Tranſgreſſions.</q> Now Sir you hearing me ſay this, that Chriſt was a Tranſgreſſor by way of Suretiſhip only; not as the Actor of any Sin in his own Perſon, do not you traduce me ſlanderouſly, charge me with ſaying, that Chriſt was really the Blaſphemer and Murderer, and Idolater? And that becauſe I ſay, If thou be a Thief, Murderer or Drunkard, if thou haſt part in the Lord, all theſe Tranſgreſſions of thine become Actually the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Actual Imputation, as the Debts of a Bankrupt becomes a Surety, that undertakes them.

What do we with this diminutive word Rector; methinks you might Entitle God, our Great King, Soveraign Lawgiver, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and doth whatever he pleaſeth in Heaven and Earth, and you make him little Moral Rector, and as ſuch he Covenanted with his Son to bear Sin: Did God Act in a way of Government and Dominion over his Son as his Rector, when he ſaid, <hi>If thou ſhalt make thy Soul an Offering for Sin, &amp;c? Iſa.</hi> 53. Or as with one that counted it no Robbery to be equal with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. Was it not when he was with him, one brought up with him, his Delight, his Delight, his Fellow? And was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt to bear Sin, and Actually laying it upon him, the ſame Act? whereas one was Immanent, and the other Tranſient; God in laying Sin or charging Sin upon Chriſt, or executing the Puniſhment upon him, freely ſubmitting himſelf to be dealt with in a way of Juſtice, did Act as a Great Judge, the Judge of all the World, <hi>in foro Juſtitiae Divinae.</hi> Why muſt we have this mean Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for God, Rector? God did not Covenant with his Son in a way of Judicial proceeding, though that Covenant was executed in a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56391:40"/> way of Vindictive and Remunerative Juſtice. And you ſay the Puniſhment of Sin was laid on Chriſt, but not Sin it ſelf. What Juſtice is it in a Judge, or as a Rector, as you call him, to puniſh him for Sin, that is not juſtly charged with Sin, its Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on charged is the <hi>only Meritorious Cauſe of Puniſhment;</hi> where there is no Law, there's no Tranſgreſſion; and where there's no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, there can be no Puniſhment, though there may be Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings they cannot be Penal. Sin and Puniſhment are <hi>Relata</hi> in Logick as well as Law. And you ſay he was obliged to bear the Puniſhment, that we might obtain pardon, cunningly worded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; this is an anſwer to a Bill, ſaving all Advantages that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may be taken: You mean Chriſt hath bore the Puniſhment of our Sins, that we may hereafter by <hi>the Righteouſneſs of another Law</hi> obtain pardon.</p>

                        <p>We have told you the Scripture every where ſays Chriſt bore our Sin. You ſay before, that our Sins were Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt with reſpect to Guilt, as if they were not layed on the guilty. 2. We find God's People for whom Chriſt bore Sin, do often labour under Guilt of Sin. 3. Guilt of Sin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of Sin, belongs to the Committer, and all the World is found Guilty before God; or elſe it is the Judicial Charge, or Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Law, whereby the Sinner is made to deſerve Puniſhment; thus it is with Thouſands that have no ſenſe of Guilt in Conſcience. 4. Guilt in Conſcience is taken off at the application of the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt to the Soul, by the ſence of his bearing Sin. 5. Guilt in Judgment is upon proof of the Charge or Confeſſion of it, either from Conſcience of the Fact in the Perſon that committed it, or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56391:42"/> from a ſubmitting to the Charge in the place and ſtead of another, whereupon the Perſon becomes Guilty, <hi>i. e.</hi> blame-worthy, and faulty in the Eye of the Law. 6. You miſtake in ſaying Guilt is that reſpect of Sin to the Threatnings of the Law, whereby there is an obligation to bear Puniſhment. Guilt is the juſt Charge of Sin, which is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, a Tranſgreſſion of the Preceptive part; it's Extrinſick to Sin, to ſuffer Puniſhment for Sin, and though they are <hi>relata</hi> by God's Conſtitution that where-ever there is Sin there muſt be Puniſhment, yet it's not ſo by neceſſity of Nature. 7. Hence obligation to Puniſhment is from the Will of the Law-giver, and the Nature of the Law; not from the Sinner; the Law hath tyed Sin and Puniſhment together, and it's not Sin to be obliged to Puniſhment, but it is for Sin; obligation to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is part of the Wages of Sin, and not Sin in it ſelf, nor the guilt of Sin; a Murderer that is caſt, he is guilty before Sentence or Execution, not becauſe the Law will Sentence him, but becauſe he hath committed the Fact which the Law hath forbid, and therefore hath annexed a Penalty to it. There's a Privative Nature in Sin, which is a contrariety to the Goodneſs of the Law, which is the Fault, therefore the Law to avenge it ſelf makes it worthy, or deſerving ſuch a Puniſhment, and upon Tryal binds over the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to it; there's hardly to be found a difference between <hi>reatus culpae &amp; poenae,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ſaith; but Sin committed or juſtly charged upon ſome account or other, is in it ſelf by vertue of the Conſtitution of the Law an obligation to Puniſhment, being the Meritorious Cauſe thereof.</p>

                        <p>This Argument, I judge, is to prove both Poſitions.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56391:43"/> Puniſhment; when as Fault is that for which a Man is obliged to bear Puniſhment: For if the Fault remain, the Puniſhment is ſtill due.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> you prove thus: It would argue a miſtake in God, or ſuppoſe him a Propagator of Sin.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It doth argue a Miſtake in you to ſay, that's transferred from us which was never in us. For the Obligation to Puniſhment in it's active conſideration is ſubjectively in the Law, and that cannot be taken from it; it's the Debt which the Law owes to the Sinner, by reaſon of it's Sanction, and the Puniſhment is the Payment;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.3, 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> For Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the Sinners Debt, but the Law's Debt, and the Sinner's Due. The Sinner's Debt is, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duty the Law requires. His Diſobedience is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Law, a Fault blamed by the Preceptive part of the Law; and this is Guilt, <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> to which <hi>Meritum poenae</hi> doth by vertue of the Conſtitution belong. There's two reſpects in Sin. 1. To the preceptive part of the Law, and that is Fault. 2. To the Penal part, and that is <hi>Meritum.</hi> Now theſe by reaſon of the Juſtice of the Law, and the Connexion made by it's Inſtitution between the Accuſing and condemning part, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable before God; and being but two different reſpects of the ſame individual Act, it is a Fault and a Merit, and a Merit becauſe it is a Fault; the Merit is a Reſult from the Fault, and are ſuch <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> that they cannot be parted in Judgment. Now then, will not your Argument rebound upon your ſelf? Would it not argue a Miſtake in God, to lay the Merit of Puniſhment upon a Perſon that hath not any meritorious Cauſe of it in no reſpect? If the Fault be not imputed, how can the Merit? There can be no Merit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a meritorious Cauſe, and this is our Sins, and not Chriſt's, by way of Perpretation. In laying Sin on Chriſt, there are theſe things. 1. The Spirit of God ſays it's Sin, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Sin and Puniſhment: And it's abſurd if it ſhould, for Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not Sin. 2. It ſaith, It's our Sins, not Chriſt's. 3. That theſe Sins are Juridically imputed and accounted to Chriſt: The Payments by Chriſt's Sufferings is his own Money, not ours; the Debt is imputed, not the Payment: A Surety is charged with, and takes upon him the principal Debt, but doth not take Money from him to pay it; the Money is his own; the Debt is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal's transferred to him, but the Payment is the Surety's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively and properly: Therefore to ſay the Payment is imputed to the Surety is Nonſence. The Spirit of God ſpeaks expreſly,

Therefore we neeed not fear to ſay, Chriſt bore our Sins, let the Sence be what it will which the Spirit means; it was certainly ſo, as to take away the Charge of Sin, which is Fault and Blame, from before God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 4. To take it away as <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Your next Branch of Proof to the <hi>Minor,</hi> is, That to impute Sin to Chriſt, would argue him a Propagator of Corrupt Qualities. What could be done or ſaid more by a <hi>Socinian,</hi> to load the great Truths of the Goſpel with reproachful Conſequences. 1. Sin is no poſitive Quality as ſuch, but only privative. 2. All Qualities of a pernicious Nature to the Sinner, conſiſting of Natural Cauſes, are <hi>Subjecta peccati,</hi> not <hi>Peccatum</hi> it ſelf, and they are ſeparable from Sin in it's Moral Conſideration: There were in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Effects of our Sins, in Infirmity, Sorrow, Reproach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were very uneaſie Qualities, though not corrupt. 3. God himſelf tells us. He laid Iniquity upon him, and made him Sin, and yet ſaith Poſitively, He was no Committer of Sin. And you charge the Spirit of God with Nonſence and Contradiction. For you ſay, it's impoſſible to impute Sin to Chriſt any other way than puniſhing of him, it's to miſtake, and make Chriſt the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Puniſhment is not ſin; therefore what the Spirit ſaith is falſe, Sin was not laid on Chriſt at all, and yet the Spirit ſpeaks it expreſly. 4. You will inferr theſe Abſurdities. 1. That Sin cannot be laid on Chriſt but by Transfuſion, wherein you deny Imputation. 2. That Chriſt muſt be corrupted thereby: Whereas the Spirit of God tells us, he bears Sin as a Lamb <hi>without Spot:</hi> You will have it, that he had the <hi>Macula</hi> fixed on him by bearing it. 3. You will have God, by laying Sin on Chriſt, to become a Propagator of Sin. The Spirit of God ſays, he appeared <hi>to take away our Sins,</hi> and <hi>in him is no Sin,</hi> 1 John 3.5. How audacious is our Carnal Reaſon, to ſet upon Divine Myſteries.</p>

                        <p>Friend, that's a cruel Bomb to ſhoot at a good Man, to charge him with Blaſphemy. But where's the Blaſphemy, to ſay, Chriſt bore the Filth of Sin in a Sence. Is not Sin filthy under all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations? Doth not the Spirit of God call it filthy and abominable in all reſpects? 1. Is not the Guilt of Sin Filth and abominable in God's Sight? And is it not ſo, when it lies upon the Conſcience? I think the Spirit of God repreſents it always as the greateſt Foulneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. I ſay, a Conſcience polluted with Sin, to thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and unbelieving, and can't by Faith fetch and derive cleanſing Vertue from the Blood of Chriſt into their Conſciences, to ſuch nothing is clean, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. Now this is the very Rooot and Foundation of a Defilement: And what is it that takes it off, but Faith in the Sin-cleanſing Vertue of Jeſus Chriſt? The great Contrariety of Sin to the Holy Law, is the Filthineſs of Sin. And the Apoſtle tells, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. How our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences come to be purged from dead Works; it's no other way, than by the offering of Chriſt without Spot to God. This ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sacrifice, whereon he bore Sin, and was not defiled: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Conſcience of Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Guilt of Sin, (which is no other than Sin charged upon the Conſcience) is taken away; and thence the Levitical Services could not make any perfect, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Conſcience, but it's the Blood of Chriſt that ſprinkles from an <hi>evil Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 10.22. 2. A condemning Conſcience, without which we ſtand but loathſomly before God; yea, while for want of Faith we apprehend God deals with us out of Chriſt, we are very loathſom, and all our Works and Services dead, God loaths and abhors them. Is not the Vertue of Chriſt's Blood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Fountain to waſh us in, and intended eſpecially of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Pardon, and the Saints to betake themſelves to it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of it's cleanſing Vertue in that Sence? 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. Guilt of Sin then is as great a Pollution as belongs to Sin: It's no other than Sin lying upon the Conſcience with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>Greg. Nyſſon</hi> ſaith, He bore <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Again, Wherever Sin is to be purged out by Sanctification, it is to be <hi>rid away</hi> by Juſtification, but all Filth is to be rid by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that indwells. Now it is manifeſt, that the cleanſing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Blood of Chriſt applyed by Faith, is the firſt Goſpel-effectual Means of Sanctification; and it muſt be the great Cauſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56391:45"/> of Mortification; wherein we are planted together in the <hi>likeneſs of his Death,</hi> Rom. 6. And what did Chriſt in his Death, but deſtroy the Body of Sin by carrying it away? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. He hath by carrying away ſin, aboliſhed Sin and Death, ſlain the Enmity that lay in Hatred of God, Pravity and Dominion of ſin. Whence was it that <hi>David</hi> was cleanſed from Blood-guiltineſs? Was it not from it's being laid on Chriſt? Was it not that very Filthineſs of his Sin? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. Doth he not pray to God to be waſhed throughly from his ſin, and to be cleanſed from it? Was not that by the Application of the Blood of Chriſt? Doth he not mention all his Pravity, Original as well as Actual, from which he would be purged as with <hi>Hyſſop, and made whiter than Snow?</hi> And wherein lies this Waſhing? Is it not in reſpect of ſin? (not in reſpect of Puniſhment, he mentioneth not) he explains what he means, it is that radical Waſhing, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Hide thy Face from my Sins, and blot out mine Iniquity, i. e.</hi> From the Face of God's Juſtice. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Creation of a clean Heart; <hi>He gave himſelf for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all Iniquity,</hi> Tit. 2.14. There is no Pravity, Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Pollution of Sin what-ever, that is ſo but becauſe of it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to the preceptive part of the Law, muſt firſt have it's Foundation of cleanſing from Chriſt's bearing of it away, and this Faith applying purifies the Heart from the indwelling <hi>Macula</hi> in us. Whence that Promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56391:45"/> the Face of Chriſt, doing that which the worſt of Men did to him, and juſtifying his Murderers: I am ſurprized with great horrour to hear ſuch things out of the Mouth of a Man that is called a Goſpel Miniſter. I pray God give you Repentance, and lay not theſe things to your Charge.</p>
                        <p>But Sir, you have here declared your defiance of the Date of the Imputation of our Sins to Chriſt, and yet would pretend you hold that Doctrine by ſaying God laid the Puniſhment of Sin only upon Chriſt. The meer Puniſhment of Chriſt (I muſt tell you) was not the bearing our Sin; for the bearing the Puniſhment was the payment of the Debt, and was his Righteouſneſs which is Imputed unto us: if Imputation of our Sins to Chriſt lay in nothing elſe, they were not Imputed at all to him; Puniſhment was laid upon him, and he bore it by way of Suffering in his Humane Nature, and was that Righteouſneſs that is Imputed to us in Juſtification, the Argument againſt you is this:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That which is Imputed to us was not Imputed to Chriſt, but Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Chriſt to Satisfaction for our Sins, is his Righteouſneſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us.</hi> Ergo, <hi>not the Imputation of our Sins unto him.</hi> If your rooted prejudices will ſuffer you to conſider, I pray weigh well that Argument, you will have more by and by.</p>
                        <p>But you ſtill ſay if Chriſt bore Sin he muſt be polluted with Sin. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It argues not that Sin was his by perpetration or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but only by Imputation, they were our Sins by Perpetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Inheſion, which he bore by Imputation: The Spirit of God tells us he was a Sinner in one reſpect, and no Sinner in another; as the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was Poor in one reſpect, and Rich in another. <hi>Omnia diverſa natura ſua abſtractâ ſunt oppoſita;</hi> as Poverty and Riches, Sin and no Sin; <hi>tamen eidem attributa ratione tantum diſſentiunt;</hi> as a Man may be Rich and Poor, Wiſe and Fooliſh in divers reſpects.</p>
                        <p>And as to the filthineſs of Sin it could not ſtain him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained untouched in his Holy Nature, but yet I muſt tell you, as bearing Sin by the Sacrifices cauſed a Typical Uncleanneſs, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Bodies were Burnt without the Camp, and they that Burnt them and gathered up the Aſhes became Unclean; ſuch a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial uncleanneſs was Jeſus Chriſt our Sacrifice under, wherein he anſwered thoſe great Types, and we are not without ample proof of it, eſpecially from <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11.</p>

                        <p>To conclude, becauſe you will have it, that in pleading for the Imputation of our Sins to Chriſt, I muſt hold that Chriſt was the very Tranſgreſſor. See what I ſaid: <q>There is a certain tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of Sin on Chriſt, ſo real, that indeed a Believer though an Actual Tranſgreſſor is as abſolutely and truely diſcharged of his Sins as if he himſelf had not committed them. As a Debtor when a Surety hath taken the Debt on him, and the Debtor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an Acquittance and Diſcharge, he is as free of the Debt now as if he never run into the Debt: So I ſay it is with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Chriſt being made a Surety of a better Teſtament, and thereby becoming really and truely the Debtor, inſtead of the Believer, he ſo bears all the Debts himſelf, that they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther releaſed and diſcharged, as if they had never been in Debt. Still I ſay, this hinders not, but there is an Acting of Sin, and Committing of Sin every day by a Believer, but ſtill the vertue of Chriſt's Suretiſhip takes off the Sin as ſoon as it is committed; nay he hath a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> or Stock in Bank to ſatisfie it as ſoon as it is Committed.</q> Dr. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 289.</p>

                        <p>If this be Mr. <hi>Antinomians</hi> Judgment, I ſee not but it is ſound, and according to the Scriptures; and you have little reaſon to make ſuch a noiſe as you have done, and load him ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiouſly with your loathſom Conſequences, and miſrepreſent him ſo hideouſly to the World, as if he were a Perſon of no Divinity, Logick, Religion, Brains, or common Senſe; I muſt confeſs, I think you have given a great deal of Ground of juſt offence, in wreſting the words and ſence of ſo good a Man; beſides your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage to inſinuate to us Errours; for I apprehend your Spleen is moſt eſpecially vented at the Doctrine of Imputation, it's that which you principally aim at to Wound and caſt to the Ground.</p>
                        <p>Laying Sin on Chriſt no other than that whereby Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes accountable to God for our Sins, and there is in it theſe things very eaſie and plain to be underſtood.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56391:46"/>1. Chriſt's Offering himſelf freely to be accountable to God for our Sins; becauſe none can be forced to be accountable for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of another. 2. His anſwering the Will and Pleaſure of the Law-giver, the Judge of all therein, being called thereunto and accepted in ſo doing, in the room and ſtead of the Delinquents. 3. Hence it is for our Sins and not his own, that he is accountable. 4. Our Sins are the Material and Meritorious Cauſe of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which he takes upon him; our very Faults in non-conformity to the Law; our Sins in the delinquency, our very Sins in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Puniſhment, our Sins in their greateſt foulneſs, under the greateſt Aggravations, they are the very offending, meritorious Cauſes; and whereas when we are without Chriſt they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the offending and the meritorious Cauſe of Suffering to us; ſo Chriſt being ſubſtituted in our room, they are the very offending meritorious Cauſes of Suffering to him; Sin hath a double reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ct as a Fault and Demerit, but as a fault is a demerit. To be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable is to ſtand under the demerits of Sin; and indeed that is Guilt; or <hi>reatus culpae,</hi> which the Orthodox mean when they ſay Chriſt bare the guilt of Sin, and it's no other than the charge of Delinquency. <hi>Dignitas poenae &amp; obligatio ad poenam</hi> is the ſame thing, and there's little weight in the diſtinction between <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> and <hi>Reatus Poenae;</hi> for <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Dignitas Poenae propter Culpam.</hi> D. <hi>O.</hi> 280. And hence they ſay there's no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Guilt and the Sin it ſelf; for Sin is no poſitive thing but privative, and that which is remaining beſides the Phyſical Act of that which is a Moral Guilt, or juſt Charge of Abberration from the Rectitude and Duty required in the Law, for which Men muſt be accountable to God, and according to the ſanction of the Law give ſatisfaction; and that is in this caſe by receiving the Wages of Sin, and in ſo doing the Payment is made.</p>
                        <p>And I ſhall now prove by many Arguments that it's our Sins, and our Sins in the higheſt degrees and aggravations that Chriſt was accountable to God for, and that he bore them in this ſence, by way of Imputation, though none of the <hi>macula</hi> or ſtain by way of Inherent pollution or defilement fell upon him, nor could cleave unto him. And we defend the Poſition as the Spirit of God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſtates. it. That it was Sin as <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="1">1. That which is the Radical Cauſe of God's diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Sinner was laid upon Chriſt to take away, but Sin was the Radical Cauſe of God's diſpleaſure, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sin in the radical Nature
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56391:47"/> of it as it's a Fault, and blamed of God as ſuch. Now obligation to Puniſhment is not the Cauſe of God's diſpleaſure, but the effect of it; that which renders a Perſon abominable in the ſight of God is Sin, as it's againſt the preceptive part of the Law: as to the Major it's plain, unleſs the Radical Cauſe of God's manifeſting diſpleaſure be taken away, God cannot be reconciled to us; it's called <hi>the Enmity, Eph.</hi> 2. even on God's part, which is upon the default of Sin, and it's Enmity on ours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That which Chriſt bore in his Body on the Tree, was Sin it ſelf, our Blame as well as Demerit; for there's no demerit where there's no blame: He that ſuffers for a fault bears the fault; the fault ſtands and claims the Meritoriouſneſs of Sufferings.

                        <p n="3">3. That the fault of Sin is ſeparable from the Perſon of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but can never be ſeparated from the demerit without payment. <hi>David</hi>'s Perſon is freed from the fault of Murder, but his Murder cannot be freed from the deſert of Death: Now that which Chriſt did eſpecially, was to make the Elect without fault before God, to take off that relation which they had to the Law, lying as to the blame of it. God's Reconciliation to the Perſons of Sinners is by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fault of Sin before God, and this is done by the Perſon of Chriſt bearing Sin.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That in a Sinner which is to be pardoned whenever he receives Chriſt, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To ſave him from the Gallows, but charge him never to ſee his Face.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That without the taking away of which the Conſcience of a Sinner can never be purified from Guilt, was certainly laid upon, and taken away by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 14. But the Fault of Sin is ſuch without the taking away of which before God, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can never be purified from Guilt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the fault of Sin was

                        <p n="6">6. If the Wages of Sin be in the very Nature of Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritual Death and it be inſeparable from <gap reason="foreign">

Ergo,</hi> he that by Death ſlays our Death, ſlays and carries away the Sin which is this Death. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. calls the <hi>Body of Sin</hi> the <hi>Body of Death,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That which Eſſentially belongs unto Chriſt's Office as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, muſt be performed by Chriſt, but bearing our Sins ſo as to take them away before God, is Eſſentially belonging to Chriſt's Office as Mediator. It's not the Eſſential part of a Mediator to bear the Puniſhment of the wronged Party, but to reconcile the Parties at variance; he may ſave one Party from utter Ruine by bearing Puniſhment, yet cannot reconcile them without taking away all matter of offence; but it is the fault of Sin that is the cauſe of variance; God hates it, and the Sinner loves it. God is not offended at the Creature becauſe he muſt be puniſhed, but becauſe it's he who hath broke his Law, therefore he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If the Creature will never be Reconciled to God till it hath ſome proſpect of God's being reconciled firſt, by Chriſt taking away the fault of Sin before God, then Chriſt bore it away; but the Creature will never be reconciled to God without this proſpect; <hi>Ergo:</hi> for the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> as to its Efficacy is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And it's there deſcribed to be <hi>God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt</hi> firſt <hi>Reconciling the World to himſelf;</hi> and how is he ſaid to be ſo, but by <hi>making Chriſt Sin for us</hi> who knew no Sin.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. All the Sin-offerings of the Law hold forth Chriſt's bearing Sin; if you conſider their Names, the proper Sin-offering was called <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, was in order to the making Peace and Reconciliation for the Sinner; therefore in the Conſecration of all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56391:48"/> theſe, there was the charging them with Sin by the laying on of the hands of them that brought them, to be Offered up for them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3. The Hebrew Doctors ſay, all Oblations of Beaſts which particular Perſons Offer of Debt, or voluntarily, they lay hands on them, and ſo it was on the daily Sacrifice, as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.2. ſaith, ſignifying that it was conſtituted inſtead of the Sinner, and the Sacrifice placed in the Sinners Room, thus charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Sins, the Prieſt was to offer to make Atonement by, to Expiate and make Reconciliation in regard of Man's Sin, and God's Wrath for the ſame. That theſe Sacrifices were Types of Chriſt, our Sacrifice in beating Sin, appears abundantly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28.</p>
                        <p>Neither do we ſay, that this bearing of Sin by Chriſt doth free a Perſon from being <hi>formally a Sinner,</hi> but becauſe we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Sinners, therefore our Sins are thus born to <hi>bring us to God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.

                        <p n="1">1. <q>If Guilt of Sin was not Imputed to Chriſt, Sin was not Imputed to him in any ſence, for the Puniſhment is not Sin.</q>

                           <q>I was ſpeaking to that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>It is God that juſtifies, who is he that condemns?</hi> I ſaid the ſame God that juſtifies, will not eat his own words, and paſs Sentence of Condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Perſon that hath received the Sentence of Abſolution alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: No, you will ſay, God doth not Condemn, but he will let Sin be charged upon the Spirit of a Man; doth not he then Sentence him to be unjuſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be divers Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Condemnation in Sentence, and Condemnation in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56391:50"/> Condemnation in Sentence is the pronouncing ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guilty. The other is the Execution of Puniſhment deſerved for this guilt, and it's but an effect of Condemnation, rather than Condemnation it ſelf; ſo far as God charges fault upon a Perſon, ſo far he condemns that Perſon; ſo that if God ſhould charge a Perſon as faulty, how can you believe ſtill that this Perſon is manifeſted and pronounced juſt by God? I beſeech you ſtop your Ears againſt the Quirks of Satan, and of your Hearts deceived by him, clamouring ſtill to you, that Sin lyes upon your own Spirits. It is but the Voice of a Lying Spirit in your own Hearts, that ſaith, That you that <hi>are Believers</hi> have yet Sin waſting your Conſciences, and lying as a Burden too heavy for you to bear, [now comes in the words which you rehearſed] I ſay all the weight, and all the burden, and all the very ſin it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <q>Sir, I was preaching from 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. and was ſhewing Faith is the Fruit of our Union with Chriſt, and prov'd it from, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches;</hi> and I ſhewed that there muſt be a Union to Chriſt before the Branch could bring forth Fruit; and that Fruit is Faith, and proceeds from our Radical Union with Chriſt. I alſo alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Your Life is hid with Chriſt in God, &amp;c.</hi> And inferred that the Life of every Elect Perſon hath a Being in Chriſt before he doth believe; believing therefore doth not produce a new Life that was not before, [<hi>i. e.</hi> Fundamentally and Efficaciouſly to the producing of Faith,] but it makes that Life that was before an Active Life, or is an Inſtrument by which that Life which was hid in Chriſt, doth now after believing become an Active, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Life in this Perſon.</q> So that all that can be made of this, is that till believing there is no Life and Activity in the Perſon that is Elected, his Life is in Chriſt, and was in Chriſt, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56391:51"/> reſerved in Chriſt for him till the time of Believing; and then doth he, the Elect Perſon become Active in Life when Chriſt doth give him to believe actually. <hi>D. C.</hi> 615.</p>

I ſay if Perſons are not United unto Chriſt, and do not partake of Juſtification before they do believe, but that believing is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by which they are firſt United. 1. That this in ſome reſpect would be bringing to Life a Covenant of Works, Do this and Live; whereas the Covenant of Grace runs upon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terms, Live and do this: God in the Covenant of Grace gives Life firſt, and doing comes from Life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <q>If there muſt be our Act of Believing before our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt, then thoſe Sins that were laid upon Chriſt, and taken away from the Elect, <hi>[i. e. in foro Dei]</hi> are returned back again— I ſay, if there muſt be believing before there be Union with, or Intereſt in Chriſt, it muſt neceſſarily follow the Perſon doth bear his own Tranſgreſſion, is chargeable for them, and Imputed to him— Hence,</q>

                        <p n="3">3. <q>If they bear their own Sins, till they Actually Believe, there muſt be an Hatred of God to ſuch Perſons till they Believe Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, [which is Death,] and a Perſon may perform a Vital Act in a ſtate wherein he is Actually Dead, and at the ſame time.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <q>This muſt follow, that there's Believing before Union with Chriſt, and then there muſt be ſome other Root from which this Fruit of Faith doth ſpring; and it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. expreſly, <hi>Chriſt is the Author of our Faith.</hi> I have received this Principle meerly for the vindication of the Glorious Priviledges which are proper and peculiar to Chriſt alone, and therefore refer the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith it ſelf to Chriſt; to this end I deliver, that Elect Perſons have a participation and ſhare in Chriſt himſelf, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56391:51"/> they do believe; neither would I thereby diminiſh the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Believing; for there are glorious things done by Faith in Believers: God hath honoured it above all meer Creatures in the World; he hath made it the Conduit-pipe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of all Peace and Comfort; nay of all that ſtrength which believers have all their Lives; no Faith, no Comfort, no Faith no Peace of Conſcience, no Faith no Pleaſure to walk with God— The Soul lyes in Darkneſs while in Unbelief.

                        <p n="1">1. You grant then that there is a compleat Atonement wrought, finiſhed and accepted by God; if ſo, there is a Fundamental Life of Juſtification laid up and reſerved for them in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That this precedes their Actual Juſtification by Faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this influenceth to Juſtification by Faith and is objective to Faith, and Meritorious of Faith, and of the Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working Faith.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But the Elect are not immediately pardoned, upon Chriſt's being appointed to ſuffer for them, nor as ſoon as the Atonement was made.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Antinom.</speaker>
                        <p>The Queſtion is, Whether there is not upon Chriſt's Atonement Pardon with God that he may be feared? Or whether there be not a Life laid up for them in Chriſt which needs no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it? There is a difference between Pardon and Pardoned; one is the Abſtract, and the other the Concrete. We ſay where there is Atonement for any, there is Pardon; but it follows not that becauſe there is Pardon for any, that therefore they are pardoned; there may be a Pardon Sealed for a Traytor by the King, and yet he not pardoned, but the Law proceeds againſt him, till the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is ſent down and read in Court. So the Pardon is certain and finiſhed for all the Elect, but they have not the particular Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons taken out, nor pardoned till they believe.</p>

And is it not this Act of God which reacheth every Elect Perſon unto Actual Pardon and Forgiveneſs? Yea, are we not Juſtified by this Act of God apprehended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Faith? For is not an Act of God removing Sin from us, and laying them on a Surety, a Pardoning Act.</p>

                        <p>You ſtate your Queſtions ſtill with great Ambiguity; for what mean you by <hi>the Act of laying Sin on Chriſt?</hi> The laying Sin on Chriſt muſt ſuppoſe and imply all things that conduced to the making him a compleat Sacrifice for Sin, God's Acts and his own: on God's part it's to be ſuppoſed there was not only a charge of Chriſt, but a diſcharge on Chriſt's part; not only a Subjection to the Charge, but a Suffering by way of Satisfaction; not only an undertaking of the Debt, but a payment; I ſuppoſe you mean, whether the Atonement that Chriſt made was in any ſence a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge unto the Elect; for no wiſe Perſon will give a Diſcharge to a Debtor till the Money be paid, or Suretiſhip accepted; now then we diſtinguiſh of Pardon, it was perfect and compleat by way of Impetration for all the Elect, but it hath not an Actual Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the Perſons are in being to whom it is to be applyed; and that Application in regard of the time of their Lives, is according to the diſpenſation of Grace. Now all this you ſeem to grant, and need not put to any further Queſtion; you ſay Chriſt made full Atonement for Sin, and it ſhall be certainly applyed; you ſay only that a Sinner is not diſcharged till Application: we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Diſcharge. 1. There's that which is Vertual and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and Real in Chriſt; or elſe he could not have roſe; for the Charge upon him was our Sins, and he muſt have a Diſcharge as a Surety; and it was the Elects Diſcharge in the Mind of God and of Chriſt, and really tranſacted. But 2ly, There's a perſonal ſenſible Diſcharge, which is at or by Application.</p>
                        <p>Now then in the ſame ſence that Chriſt bore our Sins by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as a Repreſentative, in that ſence we were Diſcharged; for the Diſcharge muſt be as large and full as the Charge, to the very Perſon of Chriſt, and all he undertook for, or elſe he is bearing Sin ſtill, and the Sins of ſome of the Elect muſt be ſtill upon him. And 3ly, If Chriſt obtained what he bore our Sins for, then he had a Diſcharge not only for his own Perſon, but for all he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56391:53"/> for and repreſented; and Chriſt having made good and full payment, cannot remain undiſcharged, for he finiſhed the work which his Father appointed him to do.</p>

                        <p>Chriſt wrought out our Forgiveneſs by way of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a Prieſt, and God was Atoned and Appeaſed thereby; and therein he alſo Gloriouſly Triumphed in his Kingly Office, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principalities and Powers, Triumphing over them on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>And through Death he deſtroyed him that hath the Power of Death, even the Devil, Heb.</hi> 2.14. In that place, Chriſt is meant in all his Offices; firſt as a Prieſt entred into the Holieſt of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. Application is by vertue of his Interceſſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Ends of his Death; likewiſe as a Prophet he teacheth by his Spirit and Goſpel, the Promiſe of Eternal Life, and the whole Myſtery of his Incarnation, and Sufferings, and Exaltation; he as a King Conquers and Subdues the Hearts of Sinners to himſelf, and gives forth the Promiſe of the Father, and hence there comes the Application of Pardon, and that Life laid up and hid in himſelf, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. And all the places mentioned by you, ſpeak but of our receiving Forgiveneſs, ſo all the Offices of Chriſt have the Honour due unto them, when <hi>we were Enemies we were Reconciled by the Death of his Son, Rom.</hi> 5.10. Reconciliation was by his Atonement; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. not only ſo, but through Jeſus Chriſt we have now <hi>received the Atonement; viz.</hi> through all Chriſt, in all his Offices; it's one thing to make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for God to be reconciled to us; that is the accompliſhment of the Reconciliation of God to the Elect, conſidered as Sinners: and another thing to Reconcile us, which is done by the Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, whereby alſo we receive the Atonement.

                        <p>We excepted againſt this Quirk before, as if any Man underſtood not by laying Sin on Chriſt, all things that concern the ſatisfaction to be made; ſpeaking of things by Synechdoches and Metonimy's as the Scripture doth, mentioning ſometimes the Blood of Chriſt, ſometimes his Body, for all the ſatisfaction of Chriſt by Sufferings, and by Metonymies the Croſs of Chriſt for his Sufferings on the Croſs. Secondly, Chriſt's Satisfaction had never been compleated if he had never roſe from the Dead, and then we had been ſtill in our Sins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                        <p>But let your Suppoſition go, (though no ſuch thing is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) make what you can of it; and obſerve, I pray, was not the Sins of Believers under the Law Actually taken away before Chriſt either Dyed or Roſe again? I ſay if a Creditor do accept of an Inſolvent Perſon for Paymaſter, and Cancel the Debtor's Bond, the ſaid Creditor cannot recover his Debt of the Principal, though it may affright him, fearing it is not Cancelled; there's nothing truer than that <hi>the Hand-writing of the Law that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, was taken away and Nailed to the Croſs, Col.</hi> 2.14. Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> after a long Explanation of the Text, ſaith, <q>In all theſe words this one thing is ſhewed, that by vertue of the Paſſion of Chriſt dying upon the Croſs, the Damning Power of the Moral Law was taken away, and all the Rites of the Ceremonial Law were at once abrogated. The Hand-writing of the Law bound us to Obedience, and bound us over to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for Non-performance thereof; Chriſt therefore our Surety, by performing that exact Obedience which the Law required, and undergoing the Puniſhment which the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of the Violators thereof, did that which we were bound unto by this Hand-writing; and ſo blotted out the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for the Blood of him being ſhed who was without ſpot, the Hand-writing of all faults are blotted out, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, Chriſt was made in ſubjection to the Law, that he might <hi>redeem them that are ſubject to the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. Dr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> on the place.</q> He adds,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But that is to be obſerved, this Hand-writing may be ſaid to be blotted out two ways. 1. <hi>Quoad Deum,</hi> as to God, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliter &amp; Sufficienter,</hi> Univerſally and Sufficiently, becauſe there is ſuch ſatisfaction given to God by the Blood of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Hand-writing of the Law cannot be exacted of any as Debtors, when they fly by Faith to this Redeemer, but he muſt abſolve them. 2. <hi>Particulariter &amp; efficaciter,</hi> Particularly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly, when it is actually blotted out from the Conſciences
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56391:55"/> of Individual Faithful ones who do apprehend Chriſt by Faith, [and he follows the true Spiritual ſence of this Scripture moſt Evangelically, I chuſe to give the Summ of it, becauſe it decides the whole Point in Controverſie moſt excellently,] according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. A Man in Debt cannot have Peace ſo long as he ſees he owes more Money than he can pay, and ſees he is bound in a Bond under his Hand to the payment thereof; but as ſoon as any Perſon apprehends Chriſt by Faith; immediately the Hand-writing is Cancelled [in his view] and he enjoys bleſſed peace of Conſcience. Here <hi>Paul</hi> excellently reſolveth the Caſe of doubting Conſciences by an admirable kind of Gradation; not content with what he had ſaid in the former Verſe, <hi>all your Sins are forgiven;</hi> but he adds, <hi>the very Hand-writing is Cancelled;</hi> but it may be ſaid, Happily not ſo blotted out but a new Suit may ariſe, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns therefore <hi>è medio ſublatum,</hi> it is taken out of the way; but it may be ſaid again, it may be it's kept and hid, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may be produced; yea, ſaith the Apoſtle it's Nailed to the Croſs, <hi>Cruci affixum,</hi> it is Cancelled, torn in Pieces and <hi>Nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Croſs;</hi> this he ſaith, we ought to believe; not only that Chriſt hath deſerved the blotting out of this Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that it is even Actually blotted out as to our ſelves in particular.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think Sir, now I need ſay no more of this Debate, ſeeing I have given you the Opinion of the Learned Dr. and of whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I know you are in the Point of Univerſal Redemption; and I believe your other Arguments are here Anſwered.</p>

                        <p>Arg. 4. <hi>If taking Sins of the Elect, and laying them on Chriſt was their diſcharge, they would be diſcharged before the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. D. W. p. 18.</p>

                        <p>This Argument is as it were the ſame with the former, and admits the ſame Anſwer. And would it be ſo abſurd to ſay a Believer may be diſcharged before the Death of Chriſt, were not the Faithful under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> diſcharged before the Death of Chriſt? We ſay, when the Charge of Sin is taken off from one and laid upon another, there is a diſcharge real in one ſence or another. <hi>Generaliter;</hi> but not <hi>particulariter;</hi> here is a blotting out of Sin, <hi>quoad Deum,</hi> though not <hi>quoad Conſcientiam.</hi> Chriſt took away Sin by way of Suretiſhip before he did it Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſo the Faithful before his Coming were ſaved.</p>

I am glad to ſee Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi>'s Ingenuity, that now he grants all we Diſpute about, only differs in naming a thing; you ſay the Atonement of the Wrath of God by Chriſt for Sinners (which is in my ſence Fundamentally and Really Pardon <hi>quoad Deum</hi>) is full, compleat and perfect; and that Forgiveneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it, and the Grant made in the Vertue thereof; if you had ſaid, it had been the Grant made in the vertue thereof, I take it you had ſpoken your own ſence fuller, than to ſay it ſuppoſeth the Grant made in the vertue thereof; unleſs you mean the Grant made to Chriſt as our Repreſentative, which comes more to our ſence; but let theſe Miſtakes in Expreſſion paſs.</p>

                        <p>I told you before, when we ſpake of laying Sins on Chriſt, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his offer to bear them, the Charge and Imputation laid on him, and the payment he made of our Debt, all which is the Atonement; for bearing of our Sins was an Eſſential part of it, as ſhedding his Blood was of the Payment; this payment and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin was in the Eye of God from Eternity as if already done; hence the Patriarchs were Actually and Perſonally Juſtified by it; and doth it follow that they were Juſtified without Chriſt's Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And whereas you talk of God's Acts of Forgiveneſs, you ſhould tell us what you mean; if Immanent, there's but one Act of Forgiveneſs, there's no new Acts ariſe in God, and it was <hi>the Promiſe of Eternal Life before the World began, Tit.</hi> 1. If you mean a Tranſient Act, it's but one, <hi>viz.</hi> the performance of that Promiſe to Chriſt our Surety and Head, and to us in him, <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and Fundamentally,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. <hi>This is the Record that he hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56391:57"/> given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son;</hi> and from him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, terminates in and upon us by the ſame Effectual Grace of God in Chriſt towards us; ſo that the ſame Forgiving Act of God terminates in Chriſt and in us, and therefore you muſt allow our Life of Forgiveneſs firſt in Chriſt, and then beſtowed upon us in and through him, whereby we are as Sinners brought in to him, and receive of his fulneſs both for Juſtifying and Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace.</p>
                        <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>Heathens by this Notion may be in a pardoned ſtate;</hi> you foiſt in another term to impoſe upon us, as if we had ſaid, that immediately upon laying Sins on Chriſt, all the Elect were in a pardoned ſtate; there's none can be in a pardoned ſtate before a being natural, nor before a being Spiritual at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but what hinders but that the Eternal Life which is given me, ſhould be in Chriſt before I was Born, and inferrs not that therefore when I come into the World there will be no need of Goſpel or Knowledge of Chriſt to bring me out of my Natural Eſtate into Chriſt?

Was not Chriſt Juſtified from the Sins of the Elect? for when he roſe, was there not a Radical Juſtification of all the Elect in Chriſt? If there had not been ſo, they could never have been perſonally Juſtified: but you would have Chriſt only purchaſe our Juſtification by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; but I muſt believe and ſay that he wrought out our Juſtification, which being in him, is the ſame that we do partake of; and that our Diſcharge is begun and carried on in Chriſt, and is compleated in him, and received by Faith in his Blood.</p>

                        <p>I think, as you ſaid, Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi>'s Ambiguity lyes in the word Diſcharge, concerning which you muſt diſtinguiſh, there's <hi>liberatio in Chriſto, &amp; liberatio à Christo;</hi> though Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> hath abundantly cleared himſelf, as to his Intention and Meaning; but you Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> are ſo harſh in your Cenſures, that nothing but the worſt Interpretation of his words can be admitted by you.</p>
                        <p>My Opinion is, that as Chriſt bore our Sins by Imputation; ſo he made full payment of our Debt, and had a Diſcharge ſo far as concerned himſelf and us, repreſented by him and in him; and hence through this Diſcharge, and the perfection of the New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in freedom from all Original and Actual Sin, and perfection of all Righteouſneſs, our Eternal Life which God hash given us, is fully and compleatly in him both for Grace and Glory. I ſay fully, Fundamentally, Originally, and as in a Fountain or Root, and of this fulneſs we do receive, even Faith the firſt Vital Act, and by Faith all diſcharge in Juſtification, and all conformity to him in Sanctification through the operation of the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that it was impoſſible but Chriſt muſt be diſcharged bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our common Nature, and ſtanding in our ſtead; and that we were in our meaſure diſcharged in him; but it is alſo as impoſſible that we ſhould be diſcharged perſonally, and in ours, till we had our Perſonal Beings, and were firſt in that State, and under that Wrath in ſome regard, from which we were to be delivered, and brought into the New Nature by Reconciliation and Actual Union
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56391:58"/> on our part, and till then we are Priſoners of the Law, without God, without Hope, Aliens to the Covenant of Promiſe.</p>
                        <p>This account I truſt may give both ſatisfaction, and I think it's that which is generally received as the Truth of the Goſpel by the Orthodox. I think thoſe Teſtimonies, Mr. <hi>Neonomian,</hi> brought for your Extream, do all in a manner ſay as I have ſaid, they do not ſo deny the diſcharge of the Elect before believing, as to deny Chriſt's diſcharge, and the Elects in him, ſo far as they were capable, nor do they aſſert our diſcharge in Chriſt ſo as to affirm our Perſonal diſcharge before Faith.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſaith thus, <q>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his perfect Obedience and Sacrifice of himſelf, which he through the Eternal Spirit once offered up to God, hath fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of his Father, and purchaſed not only Reconciliation, but an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, for all thoſe which the Father hath given to him.</q>

                           <hi>I premiſe two things.

                        <speaker>Antinom.</speaker>
                        <p>There is nothing in Sin but is Filth and Obliquity; God looks upon it all as ſo, as it ſtands in oppoſition both to Juſtification and Sanctification, and it conſiſts in it's Contrariety to the Moral Rectitude of the Law, and the Duty required by it; where there's no Law there's no Sin: Thoſe Actions that are groſs Sins in Men, are no Sins in Bruits, becauſe they are not under a Moral Law. And for Degrees of Innocency I know none, though there be of Holineſs.</p>

                        <speaker>Neonom.</speaker>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>With ſome as to the Guilt of Sin, which refers to the Sanction of the Law againſt Offenders; with reſpect to this, the Offenders are more or leſs Sinners, as they are forgiven or not forgiven.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Antinom.</speaker>
                        <p>With ſome! What mean you by that <hi>ſome?</hi> I judge they are <hi>Neonomians</hi> by the Glimpſe you give of them. You ſay the Guilt of Sin is no more than this, that a Man is bound over to be puniſh'd whether right or wrong; and a poor Creature that is tryed for Murder is guilty, becauſe he is to be hanged. I thought always that he was obliged to be hanged becauſe he was guilty; and if the Law finds not the Fault upon him, he is never guilty. Is it Sence to ſay, a Man is guilty? being Whipt, Burnt in the Hand, or being Hanged, never: unleſs he hang himſelf. Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Puniſhment, or the Puniſhment it ſelf, is no Sin, it's but an Effect of it founded in the Law. I do not underſtand more or leſs Sinners in reſpect of Guilt, as forgiven or not forgiven; for in the ſence of Guilt, whether the Fault be more or leſs, Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs takes all off, and all Sinners ſtand equally upon that account
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56391:60"/> before God. A Believer here on Earth is as fully forgiven as a Saint in Heaven. Juſtification admits not of Degrees. But it may be you diſtinguiſh Sinners in reſpect of Guilt, into Forgiven and not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, as Men are more eminently Sinners before Juſtification than after.</p>

                           <hi>As to the Charge of the Fact, which was ſinful, neither after-Sanctification nor Pardon will deliver a Tranſgreſſor from having been a Sinner; the Fact was his.</hi>

                        <p>I told you already the Charge of any one with ſinful Fact, which the Party had done, makes him guilty, it is a Fault; and tho it be true, that the Phyſical Act cloathed with it's moral Pravity was done by him, yet God forbid that Pardon and imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould not deliver him from being a Tranſgreſſor. I pray, Is <hi>David</hi> now a Murderer, and <hi>Noah</hi> a Drunkard? You would ſeem to ſpeak ſome great Thing, but you thought ſafeſt to change the Tenſe, and ſay, from <hi>having</hi> been.</p>

                        <p>This 2d is Guilt of Sin, which, ſay ſome, is a Relation to the Sanction of the Law: We ſay Guilt refers to the preceptive alſo, and is Fault. You ſay, to the Sanction only; and therefore I ſay, no Sin. You ſay, the guilty Perſon is no Sinner formally. What then, a puniſhable Creature? Do you mean a Creature capable of Suffering; ſo is a Dog, or a Cat, or a Horſe: Or do you mean a Man under a Law? If under a Law, he is not puniſhable but as a Sinner. Sin is <hi>Subjectivè formalis ratio poenae,</hi> Sin is ſubjectively the formal Reaſon of Puniſhment: So that a Man muſt be denominated a Sinner formally, or elſe he is not puniſhable in any way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, I would have you obſerve the things that are Aſſerted by Mr. <hi>Neonom.</hi> (for I beſeech you do me Juſtice) that it appears that I ſpeak always of the Elect as Elect, and not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and when I mention Believers, that I do not mean he was a Sinner before he believed. I will read my Diſcourſe to you taken from me as I delivered it.</p>
                        <p>Preaching from <hi>John</hi> 14.6. I was ſhewing Chriſt was the Way from a State of Sinfulneſs—<q>There is a two-fold conſideration of Sinfulneſs, from which Chriſt is our Way in a ſpecial manner. 1. That which is called the Guilt of Sin, which is indeed the Fault, or a Perſons being Faulty as he is a Tranſgreſſor. Is, 2ly. The Power and over-maſterfulneſs of Sin in Perſons: Chriſt is the way from both theſe. 1. From the Guilt of Sin. Chriſt is the way from the Guilt of Sin: It is briefly no more but this, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>d of the Guilt of Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon Tryal to be quitted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Charge of Sin that is laid, or may be laid to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56391:61"/> him, and to be freed from it: This is for a Perſon in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be pronounced actually innocent, and a juſt Perſon, as having no Sin to be charged on him: This is to be free from the Guilt of Sin. A Man is not free from a Fault, as long as the Fault is laid to his Charge; and he is then free, when he is not charged with it— He is only the way by which a poor Sinner may be pronounced innocent; and having proved, that Chriſt is the way to take away the Guilt of Sin, which, I ſay, is the Charge of Fault, by many plain places of Scripture, and by the Type of the <hi>Scape Goat:</hi> I came to anſwer this Objection, But do not thoſe that receive Chriſt actually, commit Sin? I anſwer, Yea, they do commit Sin; and the Truth is, themſelves can do nothing but commit Sin. If a Perſon that is a Believer hath any thing in the World, he hath received that; if he doth any thing that is good, it is the Spirit of God that doth it, not he: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himſelf doth nothing but Sin, his Soul is a Mint of Sin.</q> Dr. <hi>Cr. p.</hi> 3. &amp; 8.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore judge, Gentlemen, whether here I ſay, the Elect ceaſed to be Sinners ever ſince the Death of Chriſt: If Sinners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believing, much more before, in reſpect of the Indwelling of Sin and Corruption; and do not in this Sence ceaſe to be Sinners after believing. I went on,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Then you will ſay, If he doth ſin, muſt not God charge it where it is? [all this while ſpeaking of a Believer] Muſt he not be reckoned to be a Sinner while he doth ſin? <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer, No; though he doth ſin, yet he is not to be reckoned a Sinner,</q> 
                           <hi>[i. e. Being a pardoned Believer, God doth not reckon him ſo, and he ought by Faith to behold all his Sins taken away in Chriſt]</hi> 
                           <q>but his Sins are to be reckoned to be taken away from him. A Man borrows 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſome Man will pay it for him: Doth he not owe this 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſeeing he borrowed it? I ſay no, in caſe another hath paid it for him. A Man doth ſin againſt God, God reckons not his Sin to be his, he reckons it Chriſt's, therefore he cannot reckon it his, God hath laid it upon Chriſt. —'Thou haſt ſinned, Chriſt takes it off; ſuppoſing, I ſay, thou haſt received Chriſt.</q> Is this any other Doctrine than what <hi>John</hi> teaches? 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. I ſay, in one reſpect they are not Sinners, in another they are Sinners. And is this any other Doctrine than what the Scripture and all our beſt Divines teach: Therefore judge ye how juſtly now I am charged with this Error.</p>

                        <p>Is it not very unfair dealing for you to impoſe a wrong meaning upon my Words, when I expreſs my ſelf ſo plainly. If thou haſt <hi>received Christ,</hi> if thou haſt a <hi>part in the Lord Christ,</hi> who will underſtand theſe Expreſſions, but of our active receiving and partaking of Chriſt? though I do ſpeak elſewhere of our having Benefit by Chriſt, and a hidden Right in him; and it hath an Influence on us, and we are paſſive therein before we believe, yet it's not that I ſpeak of here. <q>I was ſhewing from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. that Chriſt is our great Pay-maſter, and how ſad a thing it is to have Sin lying upon our Spirits: Separate Sin from the Soul, and the Spirit hath Reſt in the worſt conditions— You will never have quietneſs of Spirit in reſpect of Sin, till you have received this Principle, [<hi>viz.</hi> By Faith] that it is Iniquity it ſelf that the Lord hath laid on Chriſt. Now when I ſay thus, I mean with the Prophet, that it is the Fault of the Tranſgreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Reckon up what Sins thou canſt againſt thy ſelf; if thou haſt part in the Lord [<hi>i. e.</hi> by Faith] all theſe Tranſgreſſions of thine became Chriſt's, [<hi>i. e.</hi> Thou ſeeſt them laid on Chriſt: Not that they were juſt then laid on Chriſt when thou believeſt: I would think your Divinity is not ſo groſs, as to aſſert that, but that a Believer by Faith ſees that he is one of thoſe Elect ones, whoſe Sins were laid on Chriſt.] What the Lord beheld Chriſt to be, that he beholds his Members to be. — So that if you would ſpeak of a Sinner, ſuppoſing that Perſon of whom you ſpeak to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt,</q> [is this ſpeaking of the Elect meerly as the Elect, and no more?] <q>you muſt not ſpeak of what he manifeſts, but what Chriſt was, <hi>pag.</hi> 271.</q> What Unſoundneſs, I beſeech you, is in this Doctrine? I pray ſpeak, Gentlemen.</p>

For, ſaith he, I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, though I ſee ſome of my Brethren here ſeem to be ſo, that will not ſpeak for the Truth when they hear a Man of Confidence run it down.

                        <p>Sins are Sins, and our Sins, (we have ſaid it again and again) and therefore reprovable in us, and to be forgiven in us by the Application of Pardon: All this hinders not, but that we be without Fault before God, and our Sins caſt behind his Back, we have a Perfection and Fulneſs of Pardon and all Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, though Sin it ſelf was never reconciled to God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſets us to the killing of it; Chriſt deſtroyed Sin on the Croſs, as to the obſtructing God's compleat Love to the Perſons of the Elect; ſo that it cannot condemn before God; but it is Sin
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56391:64"/> Yet in the Elect, and will accuſe and condemn wherever it is, or at leaſt the Law will by Reaſon of it, and therefore it hath it's Influence this way ſometimes on the Holieſt Men. It's in the Nature of Sin to condemn, but God doth not condemn for Sin; though he condemns Sin daily in the holieſt Men, and through Unbelief they are apt to think their Perſons condemned of God himſelf. When God denounceth Judgment againſt a ſinful Church or Nation, they are ordinarily, hypocritical, prophane and Apoſtate, and therefore a mixt People, many or moſt under a Covenant of Works, and a People in their Sins, which God awakens by Threatnings or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves; and therefore the places quoted by you affect us not.

Is there no difference between <hi>Forum Divinum</hi> and <hi>Humanum,</hi> Eccleſiaſtick and Civil; the Law before Man, and his Adminiſtration of it, knows no difference of Perſons, it proceeds <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> Churches cenſures is in order to a Juſtification before the Church, that by Faith and Repentance it may appear, that God hath forgiven ſuch an one, that he belongs to Electing and Redeeming Grace, and the Sinners Sin laid on Chriſt; and when they find that, they are ſoon reconciled to an offending Member. And you ſay, If Sins were laid on Chriſt, no Chriſtian Criminal can be puniſhed. A very ſad Caſe indeed; for then any Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condemned juſtly by Man's Law, can never be ſaved: For if Chriſt bore not his Sins, he can't be pardoned; nay, may not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56391:64"/> a Godly Man, through Temptation, fall into a Crime whereby he may juſtly ſuffer <hi>in Foro humano;</hi> and doth this hinder his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt? And is it an Argument his Sins were never laid on Chriſt? Are not theſe conſiſtent, a Sinner and condemned by Man's Law, and an abſolved Sinner by the ſatisfy'd Law of God? Was not the converted Thief a Sinner juſtly condemned by Man, though abſolved by God, becauſe Chriſt bore his ſins on the Croſs; and if he had repented before he had been hanged on the Croſs, would it have freed him from Man's Sentence. Satisfaction to God's Law is not to Man's, nor Satisfaction to Man's is not to God's. Men ſtay not Execution of a Malefactor becauſe he repents to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but Man's Law muſt take it's courſe upon him. I doubt not but the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate</hi> can teach you better Divinity than this. A Man may be in one reſpect guilty, and in another not: And ſo likewiſe God deals with his Children two ways, in caſe of their eminent Falls, in a way of his common Providential Government of the World, <hi>in foro mundi,</hi> as he dealt with <hi>David,</hi> that thoſe Evils of Affliction (Judgments in the Apprehenſion of the Men of the World) ſhould befall them; and ſo in the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of external, common Calamities, there ſhould not be any manifeſt difference between them and other Men. Therefore the Wiſe Man ſaith, That Love and Hatred is not known by theſe things. But notwithſtanding all this, the other and certain way of God's dealing with them, is according to the Covenant of Grace, which is the Secret of the Lord: he fully pardons their Sins, is reconciled to them in Chriſt, will never leave or forſake them, his Loving Kindneſs ſhall not depart from them, and all things ſhall work together for their good.</p>

                           <hi>An Hundred ſuch Conſequences naturally proceed from this Error, which fully tends to render Sin and Sinners Innocent: Not to ſay what Popery is in it, as if Juſtification did remove the Filth of Sin.</hi>

                        <p>As for danger of Popery, where is moſt, in Juſtification by Free Grace, or Works?

For according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Divinity, there is no Sin, no Death, no Malediction any more in the World, but in Chriſt that is the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> that <hi>hath taken away the Sins of the World; who is made a Curſe, that he might deliver us from the Curſe.</hi> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, according to Philoſophy and Reaſon, Sin, Death, and the Curſe are no where elſe but in the World, in the Fleſh, or in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for as a Sophiſtical Divine can ſpeak no otherwiſe of Sin, than doth a Heathen Philoſopher: Like as the Colour (ſaith he) cleaveth to the Wall, even ſo doth Sin in the World, in the Fleſh, and in the Conſcience: Therefore it is to be purged by contrary Operations. But True Divinity teacheth, there is no Sin in the World any more; for Chriſt, upon whom the Father hath caſt the Sins of the World, hath vanquiſhed and killed the ſame in his own Body. He once dying for Sin, and raiſed up again, dyeth no more. Therefore where-ever there's a true Faith in Chriſt, there is Sin aboliſhed, dead and buried; but where no Faith in Chriſt is, there Sin doth ſtill remain: And albeit the Remnants of Sin be ſtill in the Saints, becauſe they believe not perfectly, yet are they dead, in that they are not imputed unto them, becauſe of Faith in Chriſt</q>

                        <p>My Words were theſe, <q>Now there was a pitch'd Time wherein God did ſerve Execution actually upon him, and that was, when God did forſake this Son of his, when he called him forth, and ſerved Sin upon him as the Deſert of Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he ſaid, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c.— Now was the time of Payment and Satisfying God.</q> Dr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 356.</p>
                        <p>I do not ſay that this was the firſt time of his bearing Sin, he bore them in the Garden, and was there <hi>ſorrowful unto Death,</hi> and lay under Soul-ſufferings; but upon the Croſs he finiſhed his greateſt Sufferings, made payment in full; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſcribes his bearing of Sin moſtly to that time when he was upon the Croſs, and under Complaint of the Puniſhment of Loſs, God's forſaking of him.

I think there's no great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us in theſe things, provided you do but grant this Obligation was from the Demerit of our Sins, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily inferrs the charging our Sins upon him as a <hi>Fidejuſſor</hi> or <hi>Sponſor,</hi> that takes upon him another's Debt; and you ſay alſo, Satisfactory Atonement; wherefore God was ſatisfyed with the Payment made.

                           </q> for where Iniquity is, there will be a ſeparation from God.</p>
                        <p>And my Argument ſtands thus, Where there is a forſaking of God, there is a ſeparation from God in the ſenſe of ſins ſeparation from God; but in Chriſt's bearing Sin there was a forſaking of God; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <q>It may be this forſaking was but for a little moment. <hi>A.</hi> It was as long as Sin was upon him, had not Chriſt breathed out the Sins of Men that were upon him, he had never ſeen God again; he having taken Sin upon him, he muſt firſt unload himſelf of Sin before he could be brought near to God; therefore you find that paſſage in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. <hi>Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Expounded by the Apoſtle of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. As if the Lord at the Reſurrection of Chriſt did beget his Son a new as it were; there was a ſeparation and forſaking when Chriſt dyed, but at the Reſurrection there was a meeting again, a kind of renewing of Sonſhip with God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is Chriſt that dyed, yea, rather that is riſen again from the Dead, and ſits at God's Right Hand;</hi> and what doth he inferr from thence? <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect, i. e.</hi> till Chriſt himſelf came off from Mens Sins, Men were in danger of being Charged with Sin, but Chriſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56391:67"/> hath dyed and made ſatisfaction, nay, rather is riſen again, and hath his Diſcharge, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 295.</q>

                           <q>My reaſon of that Aſſertion was added, for Chriſt to be given to die, comes ſhort of the Love he expreſſeth in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin; Affliction is not contrary to the Nature of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Sin is; where God doth Charge any Sinner he hath an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as God chargeth and ſeeth Sin.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>I ſaid, God never did do ſuch a wonderful thing to the Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Creature, as laying Sin on Chriſt; Iniquity is the hatefulleſt thing in the World to God, [therefore the Sin charged is abhorred by God] where Iniquity is found, a Toad is not ſo ugly unto Man, as that Perſon is in the ſight of God, where Iniquity is found — Sin is the moſt horrible and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, nay, the moſt abhorred thing in the World to God.</q> That this is ſo the whole Scripture bear me witneſs; but obſerve what follows — <q>That God ſhould make Chriſt to be Sin, is out of the reach of all the Creatures in the World to apprehend how God ſhould do it, and yet that he ſhould retain his own Power, by Love, and reſpect to his Son, <hi>p.</hi> 180. Now as there was an Abhorrence of Sin charged on Chriſt, yet, and accordingly a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or forſaking upon that Account, ſo far as he bore Sin in his Humane Nature; yet God did retain that Love and Reſpect to him as his Son: Neither do I ſay, that Chriſt in his Humane Nature was ſeparated from the Divine by a Diſſolution of his Hypoſtatical Union: And therefore it's a falſe Charge to ſay I ſaid, God abhorrtd the Perſon of his Son, or that there was a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Divine and Humane Natures of Chriſt.</q>

But if you will wreſt my meaning to be this, that he was ſeparated by a Diſſolution of the Hypoſtatical Union, I deny it. I ſay, <q>Should Iniquity be laid on the Humane Nature, and the Divine Nature not ſupport it, it would have ſunk under Sin, as a meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

                        <p>Truth. <hi>Though God teſtified his threatned Indignation againſt Sin in the awful Sufferings of Chriſt, Soul and Body, in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſuſpended thoſe delightful Communications of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, as to their wonted Degrees; yet God was never ſeparated from Chriſt, much leſs during his Body's lying in the Grave; neither was the Father ever diſpleaſed with Chriſt; and far leſs did he abhorr him, becauſe of the Filthineſs of Sin upon him.</hi> D.

                        <p>This is a marvellous Aphoriſm indeed. 1. Did God teſtifie his threatned Indignation againſt Sin in the awful Sufferings of Chriſt, Soul and Body? What is this leſs than what you would condemn for Error in me? 2. Did God ſuſpend his Delightful Communications to the Humane Nature? What was this but the Separation I always ſhewed that I intended? 3. That God was never ſeparated from Chriſt in the Hypoſtatick Union, I always
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56391:68"/> affirm: No, not during his lying in the Grave. 4. But 4ly, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, the Father was diſpleaſed with Chriſt as his Son, or in relation to him as Son by Eternal Generation, but in relation to him as our Surety, and as a Sacrifice to bear Sin, he was diſpleaſed with him, or elſe you give your ſelf the Lie in the ſame Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, where you ſay, he teſtified his threatned Indignation againſt ſin in the Sufferings of his Body and Soul; and how could this be without Diſpleaſure. 5. What have we been doing all this while? Have you not been arguing againſt Chriſt's bearing ſin? And now you ſay, God teſtified his Wrath againſt ſin in the Sufferings of Chriſt. If ſin was not imputed to him, could he bear Indignation for it? 6. And was not the Father as Judge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with Chriſt as Debtor, and bearing our ſins? How could he deal with him elſe in a way of teſtifying his Indignation, as you ſay? 7. You ſay, He did not abhorr him; ſo ſay we, not his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor in ſuch a way of Abhorrence that is in Man's Affections. God is not as Man, in natural Appetite or Averſion; but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted ſuch an Abhorrence or Averſion as was proper to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we deſire to term it but as you do, <hi>a manifeſtation of threatned Indignation to Sin, condemning Sin in the Fleſh of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.8. As Chriſt was made ſin, doth not the Spirit of God ſay he was <hi>made a Curſe?</hi> Is not Sin a curſed thing, that which is odious and abhorred? Suppoſe then we uſe not thoſe Words <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Abhorred,</hi> and we ſay, God teſtified his threatned Indignation againſt ſin in Chriſt, even to the making him a Curſe for us: What greater and higher Expreſſion can be uſed? And how could God's Indignation be ſhewed againſt ſin on a perſon upon all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts innocent, no way chargeable? Sin can't ſuffer Indignation, but the Sinner may: Sin in the Abſtract is not capable of Suffering, it muſt be ſin bringing ſome Perſon under a Law-Condemnation, ſo that he have the Denomination of a Sinner. 9. And whereas you will not have ſin filthy, where is it the Spirit of God repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it any otherwiſe, and the efficacy of Chriſt's Sacrifice as to the Purgation of Filth? therefore it's ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56391:70"/> there appeared more than Humane Courage in Chriſt's Outcry, yet it's certain it was uttered from Extremity of Grief. Verily, this was his chiefeſt Conflict, and more grievous than all his other Torments, becauſe that in his Anguiſhes he was not ſo refreſhed with his Fathers Holy Favour, that he did in ſome reſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him alienated from him; for neither did he offer his Body only as the Price of our Reconciliation with God, but in his Soul he bore the Puniſhment due to us; and they are Men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury Spirits, that ſlighting this part of Redemption, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only on the external Puniſhments of the Fleſh; for as Chriſt ſatisfied for us, ſo it was requiſite that he ſhould be ſet as guilty before God's Tribunal: For nothing is more horrible than to perceive God as a Judge, whoſe Wrath exceeds all Deaths — Neither doth he complain Feignedly or Theatrically that he was deſerted of God, according to the inſipid Cavils of ſome: For the inward Grief of his Soul from the Depth of Anguiſh, compelled him to break forth into this Outcry. He did perfectly fulfill the Law, endured moſt grievous Torments immediately in his Soul.</q>

                                 <hi>Calv.</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</note> which is more; for it ſhews that all Malediction was included in him: This may ſeem hard, that it may look like a Reproach to the Croſs of Chriſt in Confeſſion, of which we glory: But God was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what kind of Death his Son ſhould die, when he ſaid, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> But one may here object, How comes it to paſs that the Son in whom the Father delights, ſhould be accurſed? I anſwer, Two things are here to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only in the Perſon of Chriſt, but alſo in his Humanity: One is, that he was the <hi>Lamb of God without ſpot,</hi> full of Bleſſing and Grace. The other, that he took our Perſon; therefore he was a Sinner, and under the Curſe, not ſo much in himſelf as in us, but yet it was neceſſary he ſhould die in our ſtead, which he could not do out of the Grace of God; and yet he underwent his Wrath, elſe how could he reconcile the Father to us, whom he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56391:70"/> looked upon as incenſed againſt us; therefore the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did always reſt ſatisfied in him. Again, how could he free us from the Wrath of God, unleſs he had tranſlated it from us to him; therefore he was wounded for our Sins, and experienced God as an angry Judge. This is the <hi>fooliſhneſs of the Croſs,</hi> but admired by Angels, and ſwallows up all the Wiſdom of the World.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>We muſt not imagine Chriſt to be innocent, and as a private Perſon, (as do the Schoolmen,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Luther</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14.</note> and almoſt all the Fathers have done) which is holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for himſelf only. True it is, that Chriſt is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt pure and unſpotted; but thou muſt not ſtay there, for thou haſt not yet Chriſt, although thou know him to be God and Man: But then thou haſt him indeed, when thou believeſt that this more pure and innocent Perſon is freely given unto thee of the Father to be thy Prieſt and Saviour; yea, rather thy Servant, that he putting off his Innocency and Holineſs, and taking thy ſinful Perſon upon him, might bear thy Sin, thy Death and thy Curſe, and might be made a Sacrifice and Curſe for thee, that by this means he might deliver thee from the Curſe of the Law.</q>

                        <p>

For as Chriſt is innocent in this general Law touching his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo is he alſo in all the reſt. And as he is guilty in this general Law, in that he is made a Curſe for us, and is hanged upon the Croſs, as a wicked Man, a Blaſphemer, a Murderer, a Traytor, even ſo is alſo guilty in all others. For all the Curſes of the Law are heaped together, and laid upon him; and therefore he did bear and ſuffer them in his own Body for us; he was therefore not only accurſed, but <hi>made a Curſe for us.</hi>

He drank the firſt Draught of the Cup of Wrath, and afterwards it's ſaid, <hi>He was in an Agony:</hi> There was the Second upon the Croſs: He drank up the Bottom and Dregs of the Cup of Vengeance, and ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> John 19.30. He was curſed of God in an eminent manner, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21, 22, 23. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 13. If a Man be guilty of Sin worthy of Death, and to be hanged for it, then he is accurſed, otherwiſe not; Chriſt was accurſed hanging on the Tree, and therefore it's certain he was guilty of our Sins charged upon him, being the greateſt Sinner by Imputation; and hence he was really curſed of God, and that in an eminent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56391:71"/> manner; and not only curſed, but a Curſe in the Abſtract; whereby it is moſt evident that he ſuffered the immediate Impreſſions of the Wrath of God, and the Second Death, which takes poſſeſſion of the whole Man, and therefore muſt have ſuffered while his Soul and Body were united, or ſtanding together; he was thoſe three Hours in the Darkneſs of Hell, encountring the Powers of Darkneſs, and wreſtling with the Wrath of an infinite God: Man by Sin having diſpleaſed ſuch an infinite God, muſt ſuffer that infinite Diſpleaſure which Chriſt ſuffered in our, room.

Nay more, we are the ſame Righteouſneſs, for we are made the Righteouſneſs of God; the very ſinfulneſs that we were, Chriſt is made that very ſinfulneſs before God. So that here is a direct Change; Chriſt takes our Perſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſtands in our ſtead; we take Chriſt's Perſon and Condition, and ſtand in his ſtead — So that if you reckon well, you muſt always reckon your ſelves in another's Perſon, and that other in your Perſon: God gives Chriſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>God gives the Perſon of Chriſt to Men, as much as to ſay, God gives Chriſt to ſtand in the Room of Men, and Men to ſtand in the Room of Chriſt; ſo that in giving Christ it is as it were to make a change,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>When I ſpeak of compleatly ſinful and righteous, you muſt know that I ſtill underſtand by way of Imputation, that which was not originally in the Subject; and ſo the Perfection is a Perfection of Imputation, which is as real and compleat in its kind as any Relative Perfections. A Man may be a weak ſickly Man but a perfect Father; a Poor Man, but as perfect a Son as the Son of the Richeſt; a Man may be free from Debts, and yet make himſelf as perfect a Debtor for the Debts of others as any Man for his own; and a Man may be a poor, wretched, miſerable Creature, but made as Righteous in reſpect of the Law as the Richeſt Man on Earth, by the Money of another Man; that which denominates a Man perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteous is this, that he oweth nothing to the Law; and if a Man be worth but Forty Shillings, and owe nothing, he is as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in a Legal Righteouſneſs, as he that hath a Thouſand Pound; therefore it's no Hyperbolical Expreſſion for one that owes nothing to the Law, to ſay, I am as Righteous as the King, meaning ſuch a Righteouſneſs which the Law requireth of him, reſpecting the Precept or Sanction, Active and Paſſive Obedience; I mean not the Righteouſneſs of Legiſlation or Execution of Juſtice in a way of diſtribution, but ſuch a Righteouſneſs that I am capable of. So when I ſay, we are as Righteous as Chriſt, I mean not Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Righteouſneſs as you ſuggeſt; I do not mean <hi>Juſtitia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatoria, ſed Juſtitia Mediatoris;</hi> not Mediatorial Righteouſneſs, but the Righteouſneſs of the Mediator.</p>
                        <p>When I ſay I am as Righteous now (after my Debt of Five Pound is paid, and owe no more in all the World,) in the Eye of the Law, as my Friend that paid my Debt, and fetched me out of Priſon: I do not thereby ſay that I have as good an Eſtate as he, or that I have ſo many Thouſand Pounds as he; or as able to pay the Debts of others as he is; and as for the other part of your Charge about our commutation of Perſon, I juſtifie my ſelf
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56391:73"/> in it, that as Chriſt bore my Sins by Imputation, ſo I have his Righteouſneſs, and am Righteous in his Righteouſneſs, by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56391:74"/> reſpect of Election was uncertain. 2. And but certain in another way, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a Conditional Grant that is not yet performed, and belongs to the Non-elect as well as to the Elect; and there's yet an Uncertainty remaining, notwithſtanding the Certainty purchaſed. 3. It's very odd to ſay, Chriſt purchaſed a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and a conditional one too, the Condition whereof muſt be ſomething not purchaſed to be performed by us, that we may have the Gift promiſed: For if the Certainty depend upon the Merit and Purchaſe, then both the Condition and Promiſe is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and then the Purchaſe is abſolute. I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the certainty of the Salvation of the Elect be purchaſed conditionally or abſolutely; if purchaſed conditionally, then this Propoſition, <hi>The Elect ſhall be ſaved,</hi> is yet uncertain in reſpect of the Purchaſe of Chriſt, and is but a contingent Propoſition, and not certain, which is a Contradiction. If you ſay Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed abſolutely the Salvation of the Elect, all your contingent Purchaſe falls to the Ground: But Chriſt purchaſed Perſons abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, not conditional Propoſitions; and is <hi>he that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> a conditional Propoſition indeed?</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, you would think that Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> had here owned the Doctrine of Imputation; but it is nothing ſo, he doth but ſham it ſtill. Mark, he ſays, Beſides the Effects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to Effects, or Effectualneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pardon and Acceptance is the Effects; but he tells you not that it is the proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Righteouſneſs, he will have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to have ſome Effects, and is imputed as to ſuch: So that Sanctification and Glorification being Effects, are as much the Imputation of the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It's a ſtrange thing to confound the Cauſe and Effects; to tell us the very Cauſe is imputed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to tell us he means the Effects: This is to talk Daggers; for Cauſe and Effect are <hi>oppoſita.</hi> But he ſaith, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is what was undertaken and deſigned for their Salvation, and is effectual, and in that Senſe imputed. Very good; ſo that it was a ſubordinate means to accompliſh that end, as was alſo Creation, (which was by Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.) preaching the Goſpel, their Calling, Sanctification; hence the Imputation of Chriſt's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56391:75"/> Righteouſneſs is but to give it a place in the order of means for our Salvation, and in that order of means hath it's Effects. But he ſaith, there is a Priviledge by it as well as a proper Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it's pleadable for their Security. I would know how it comes to be pleadable; is it from its own certainty to us, and our Salvation by it, or from our performance of the condition of the Grant? if a Conditional Grant he purchaſed, we cannot plead the certainty of our ſtate from the purchaſe, but very remotely after another plea firſt; if the condition of the Grant be never ſo ſmall, we muſt firſt plead it, before we can plead the purchaſe; we muſt have a plea for the right to the purchaſe before we can have any plea to the Grant by the purchaſe. Laſtly, he ſaith, The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is as uſeful this way as any, as if Chriſt had ſuffered in their ſtead he means; <hi>i. e.</hi> a New Goſpel will do your buſineſs as well as the Old and True.</p>

This is little better than Nonſence; however your meaning lyes very fair in it, that our acceptance to God's poſitive Favour and Love is not here, but elſewhere; and Acceptance as to Excluding Bars, is only a Negative acceptance, an Acceptance and no Acceptance; the removing the Bars and Obſtacles to acceptance, ſuppoſeth there may be an acceptance upon ſome other Terms.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56391:79"/> partaking of the Vertues of Mediation and Imputation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible Terms? Thoſe Reverend Divines do not ſay, the Mediation of Chriſt was imputed to us, no more than his Kingſhip, Prieſtſhip, Prophetical Office; yet we are in a Sence made Kings, Prieſts and Prophets, but not by Imputation: They tell you only of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Mediation, of which Juſtification is one.

                        <p>But you tell us, or would have us to underſtand, that the meaning of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> about Imputation, is, that the Vertue of Chriſt's Mediation (<hi>i. e.</hi> in your declared Sence) the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects only operates upon us; and then after rehearſal of the Words of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> you add, Thou ſeeſt it's Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Pardon, and not infuſed. You'll oppoſe imputation to Infuſion, which none of us plead for: But this Imputation is in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56391:80"/> your Sence only as to the Effect, which you would have us to believe is the Judgment of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and the two Aſſemblies: And I find you lamely rehearſe the Article of your Confeſſion, as being aſhamed to behold your Erroneous Doctrine ſo fully condemned by them.</p>
                        <p>Do not think ſuch pitiful little Sophiſms as theſe, are ſuch as do become a profeſſed Miniſter of the Goſpel, or that your Reverend Vouchers have not prejudiced their Honour by aſſerting ſo publickly to the World, That in all material things you have fully and rightly ſtated the Truths and Errors in this Treatiſe; and look upon this as a Work of conſiderable Service to the Church of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when your manifeſt Deſign is to hide Truth by Equivocations, falſe Repreſentations, and odious forced Conſequences; and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe old palpable decried Errours. <hi>Veritas non querit angulos.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, Sir, that you may ſee we have more than Authority for this great Doctrine of Imputation of Chriſt's very Righteouſneſs:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I prove, that to ſay Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed only as to Effects, is to deny the Doctrine of Imputation.</p>
                        <p>Conſider, from the Nature of Imputation it ſelf. Imputation is the reckoning and eſteeming that unto one man, which is done by another: As in caſe of Debt or Wrong done by one Man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a third comes and does, or promiſeth that thing whereby the Offended Perſon becomes ſatisfied with the Offender, previous to which Satisfaction in Nature is his reckoning the Payment made, or to be made, unto the Offender; it's not the taking of this or that Payment in any kind that is Satisfactory for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, unleſs it be by the offended Perſon reckoned to him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon, v.</hi> 18. gives the clear Notion of Imputation both as to Wrong and Righteouſneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, If he hath criminally or unrighteouſly <hi>done thee wrong</hi> in filching or ſtealing, impute this to me, or <hi>put it upon my Account:</hi> Take me as Paymaſter, and put my Payment on his Account, <hi>i. e.</hi> In reſpect of any wrong that he hath done thee, or Debt that he owes thee; Here's my hand for it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>I will repay it to thee.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood bound for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to <hi>Philemon;</hi> and unleſs <hi>Philemon</hi> had accounted <hi>Paul</hi>'s Payment or Obligation to <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in reſpect of any Wrong ſuſtained by him, <hi>Oneſimus</hi> is ſtill peccant, and an unreconciled Offender in the Eve of <hi>Philemon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the Effects of Righteouſneſs is the Benefits received by Imputation, not Imputation it ſelf. Suppoſe the neareſt Effects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as Satisfaction, Reconciliation, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56391:80"/> Adoption, Imputation, is cauſe of thoſe Effects. God is ſatisfied, and reconciled, and juſtifies the Sinner, becauſe he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and reckons to him the payment or appeaſing Act of the Surety. I argue then,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That which is a Benefit received by vertue of Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is not imputed Righteouſneſs it ſelf, but God's being ſatisfied, reconciled, and Juſtifying us, is the Benefit only of Imputed Righteouſneſs, <hi>Ergo.</hi> As to the <hi>Major,</hi> That thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>g which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by vertue of ſomething elſe, is not the ſame with it; nay, they are <hi>contraria affirmantia.</hi> Now God's giving us the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Imputed Righteouſneſs, is that which doth in a way of Juſtice reſult from the ſaid Righteouſneſs imputed: The Imputation is the Gift of Grace, therefore Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is firſt imputed, and graciouſly reckoned ours to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes. Hence reſults in a way of Juſtice God's Satisfaction, Reconciliation, and the Sinners Juſtification. Hence it will needs follow, if there be no more in Imputation than God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfyed, reconciled, Juſtifying, I will ſay, how comes it to paſs? You'll ſay, Through Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, it's an Effect of it. I ſay ſo too. But how come we to have theſe Effects, if God never reckoned and accounted Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto us? either we are righteous ſome way or other before God declares us righteous, or we are not: If not, it's not a true Sentence: If we are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, we are ſo by our own Righteouſneſs, or anothers: if by anothers, it muſt be ſome way or other ours either by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of it eſſentially, or by reckoning and eſteeming it unto us as if it were ours; but to reckon the Effect only, is not Imputing of it at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. To ſay the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is only the beſtowing of the Effects, is to aſcribe Juſtification to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt in no other ſence than we do Sanctification and Glorification; for it is to ſay that Juſtification is but a Meritorious Benefit, and ſo is Sanctification and Glorification; for all thoſe are purchaſed and procured by him. Now there's a vaſt difference between payment of a Debt owing, and making a purchaſe of a new Eſtate: it's true Chriſt did both, he ſatisfied and he purchaſed; as for the purchaſe Money there's no need it ſhould be Imputed to us; if the Eſtate being purchaſed be beſtowed freely, it is enough, but as for Satisfaction made for our Wrong or Debt, this muſt be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned and accounted to us before we can come at a Legal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, or procured Riches.</p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56391:81"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. To ſay Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is Imputed to us only as to Effects, is to ſay, That there is ſome other Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this for us to be Juſtified by, for it implies that we are become Righteous by another Righteouſneſs; the Priviledge of having whereof is only procured by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; and the plain truth of it, the Original Riſe of this Notion is only to open way for another Righteouſneſs to come in to our Juſtification, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Goſpel; yea, not only contrary to Sound Doctrine, but Radically Deſtructive to the true Grace and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If we cannot have the Effects of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, unleſs the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be Imputed to us, then the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is Imputed otherwiſe than in Effects; but we cannot have the Effects of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Conſequence of the Major is ſo clear it needs no proof.</p>
                        <p>I prove the Minor; we cannot have the Effects of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, unleſs his very Righteouſneſs be Imputed. The Reaſons are, 1. Becauſe our Offences will ſtand in the Eye of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and we ſhall remain unrighteous, having no Righteouſneſs of our own, nor any of another reckoned to us. For we can be Righteous no other way but by our own, or by anothers; and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſignifies nothing as to us, if it be not placed to our account; and hence being not made Righteous by it, can never be Sanctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. We can have none of the Effects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all proceed from Love of Reconciliation unto Sinners; now the Enmity being not taken away by Satisfaction, there is no Reconciliation, and therefore we cannot poſſibly partake of the Effects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. To ſay we have only the Effects Imputed, is to deny Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for the Effects are not ours by Imputation, but Perſonally and Really; as ſuppoſe Juſtification, God doth not Juſtifie us by Imputing Juſtification, but really upon Imputed Righteouſneſs. 2. If Chriſts very Righteouſneſs be not Imputed or Accounted to us in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome other Righteouſneſs muſt, for God cannot Juſtifie a Sinner without accounting him Righteous by ſome very Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either of his own or of anothers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I prove that the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is Imputed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That Righteouſneſs that ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for our Offences, is Imputed unto us; but the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſatisfied the Juſtice; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Major is very evident; for if <hi>A</hi> do pay Money for <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>D</hi> to whom it is due accepts it in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56391:81"/> diſcharge of <hi>B</hi>'s Debt; then <hi>D</hi> doth place it to <hi>B</hi>'s Account, and gives a Receipt accordingly to <hi>A,</hi> as having paid him ſo much for the uſe of <hi>B.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Minor, that the very Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for us; it appears, 1. By his Intention in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf for us, and God's accepting of us in him as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. 2. Becauſe if God be ſatisfied for our Breach of the Law, it can be no other Righteouſneſs that could do it; it muſt alſo be the very Righteouſneſs, and not the Effects; now that which God was ſatisfied with upon our account, is accounted to us; for if it be not accounted to us, it is not accepted for us, our Debt ſtands ſtill, and the Hand-writing againſt us. 3. If the very Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt do not ſatisfie, no Effects of Righteouſneſs can; for <hi>nihil dat quod non habet.</hi>

                        <p>It would take up deſervedly ſome Paper to ſhew the Error and Sophiſtry of what you have ſpoken: The Summ is, that you deny Chriſt to be a publick Perſon, and that all that Grace and Fulneſs that is in him by reaſon of the Hypoſtatical Union of both Natures, and that Unction without meaſure which he received, was only to qualify him ſingly and for himſelf, as an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſon, and not to be conveyed and communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; and therefore none of his Fulneſs is received by us; that <hi>the</hi> Spirit, not <hi>his</hi> Spirit: Neither do we live by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Union to him, as a Root, Head, Fountain; but if we partake of the Divine Nature, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>We are made Gods.</hi> If we partake of the Vertues of Chriſt, we rob him, and they are no more in him. You abuſe the Similitude of Husband and Wife uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and would make it run on Four Feet. You conſider not that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt was the true Type the Apoſtle aims at to repreſent Chriſt and his Church by: <hi>Eve</hi> being taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> had her Nature in him firſt, and was created out of him, and ſo was <hi>Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone.</hi> You muſt diſtinguiſh between the Individual Perſon and Qualification of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and his publick Capacity, Headſhip and common Nature; he had a peculiar diſtinct Perſon and Habits belonging to it as ſuch, but he had alſo a common Nature communicable to his Wife and to his Poſterity by Propagation, not only <hi>Eve</hi>'s Nature, but ours was in him radically. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God made but one at firſt,</hi> Mal. 2.15. though he had the reſidue of the Spirit, and could have made more, as he did in the Creation of Angels; but therefore one, that he might ſeek a Seed of God, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Now this Seed of God was found in the Seed of the Woman that was made out of Man, and was but one; as <hi>Adam</hi> was made but one common Perſon, ſo Chriſt, and the Church his Wife is made out of him, created in him as <hi>Eve</hi> was, and have a Nature common in Chriſt. And doth it follow, that becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had the common Nature to <hi>Eve</hi> and his Poſterity, 1. That his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Qualities were communicated, taken from him, and given to <hi>Eve?</hi> Was <hi>Adam</hi> turned into <hi>Eve?</hi> Was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Wiſdom, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56391:83"/> his Natural or Moral Vertues taken from <hi>Adam,</hi> and given to her or them? The common Nature of a Genus is communicated and propagated by Individuals, without robbing the Individual. Mankind is propagated daily by Individuals, yet thoſe Individuals loſe nothing of their proper Adjuncts. If Men were not Strangers to Logick and Natural Philoſophy, and ordinary Terms of Law, they would not make ſo much ado about this common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, which in him is Myſtical and Tranſcendent.</p>

We conſider why Chriſt ought to have a fulneſs of Grace: 1. <hi>E Debito congruitatis,</hi> it was due to him in a way of meetneſs, by reaſon of his Union to the Word. 2. It was meet that which was neareſt to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing Cauſe, ſhould partake moſt of the Influx. 3. There was <hi>Debitum neceſſitatis,</hi> It was neceſſarily due, from the Suppoſition of the End, by reaſon of the Habitude [or relation of Chriſt himſelf to the Humane Nature; for Grace was conferred upon him, not as a private Perſon, but as an univerſal Principle,] from whom it is transfuſed into other Men, [you ſay it's not by Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, p. 47.] All things ought to be full, and in an oneneſs.

Chriſt is not only perfect, in whom dwells all the Fulneſs of the Godhead, but he makes us perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, we having all things in him and his Doctrine neceſſary to Salvation. 2. The Second Reaſon is taken from his Office; Chriſt is the Head. As to the firſt, We have perfect Wiſdom, right Knowledge of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 17.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. 2. We have compleat Righteouſneſs, for Satisfaction to the Law of God, and for our Sins. 3. In Chriſt we have Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or inherent Righteouſneſs: For what is Sanctification other than the waſhing away of our Errours and Vices, whereby we are ſet at a diſtance from God, and the Suſception of Gifts and Graces, whereby we may draw nigh to God in his Service— And this is done as we ſtand united to Chriſt by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 9.</q>

As the Old <hi>Adam</hi> is in us, as the cauſe of Corruption and Death, ſo the New <hi>Adam</hi> dwells in us as the Cauſe of Righteouſneſs and Salvation.

The Abſoluteneſs of this Covenant appears as to us, in that all the Federal entitling Conditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it is to be found in another, and not in us, nor wrought in us; for whatever is wrought in us, is from free Gift, and of Promiſe, and muſt have ſome condition performed by another as Federal, before we can partake of it. Therefore there's nothing in us before or after Converſion that doth belong to the Federal Condition; all our Goſpel Obedience is to be referred to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and is built upon it; therefore it's abſolute, becauſe both Chriſt, the Condition, and all the good things promiſed, are freely beſtowed upon us.</p>

A Covenant is not <hi>forced;</hi> and therefore if the Covenant of Grace were made upon conditional Terms with Sinners, it could not be a Covenant-Agreement conſummated, till they had firſt accepted the Terms. 2. It always ſuppoſeth there is a <hi>Power and Ability</hi> in the Party on whom the Covenant-Condition lies to be performed, previous to the Propoſal of the ſaid conditions, otherwiſe they would be vain and abſurd. Hence to aſſert <hi>Faith or Obedience</hi> to be the Federal Conditions, doth unavoidably throw Men into the <hi>Arminian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Free-Will,</hi> and of a Natural Power in Man to provide for his Salvation in the performance of the ſaid <hi>Foederal Conditions.</hi> But we affirm, neither Faith it ſelf; no, not the Gift of the Spirit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56391:89"/> that works Faith, not our Union to Chriſt, no Gifts that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, are Foederal Conditions.

                           <p>You ſay, That the Covenant Agreement made with Chriſt, was not the Covenant of Grace. You call it a Covenant of Redemption as another thing from the Covenant of Grace.

They are only diſtinguiſhed between the making and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting this Covenant of Grace.

You talk at leaſt very improperly; that the cauſes of Man's Salvation are adjuſted and ſecured in the Covenant of Redemption, which placeth it before Election; for I take the Grace of Election to be the firſt adjuſting and ſecuring cauſe of Mens Salvation, and not ſo only, but of the Covenant it ſelf made with Chriſt. I thought all the cauſes were ſufficiently adjuſted in the Councel of God's Will, and that by the purpoſe of Grace they were ſecured to us, and Redemption too. Chriſt's Undertaking the charge of Satisfaction and Merit, is a cauſe of our Salvation, not adjuſting and ſecuring it, they were adjuſted and ſecured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

I thought it had been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Election, that all the Elect ſhould certainly believe and obey the Goſpel, but it ſeems by what you ſay here they were only conditionally Elected, and proviſion made in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that they ſhould perform the Condition, and obey the Term, (very improper) it's to perform the Terms. Now what is in ſuch a Covenant of Grace more than <hi>Adam</hi>'s would have had if he had ſtood; for God muſt have provided that he ſhould obey or perform the Terms of Life, which were to him very ſmall and eaſie, no more than giving a Pepper-corn, or not ſo much; only to forbear plucking and eating an Apple when he had enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. There's no Eſſential Difference in your Opinion, for where-ever the Creature performs a Condition of a Covenant of God's making, God muſt provide for that performance, by Grace given and confirmed.</p>

                           <p>Rare Divinity! <hi>Mens tua ſublimis ſupra genus eminet ipſum.</hi> 1. You ſay that Covenant was not made with the Elect. The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſay it was made with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and his Seed; but you I ſuppoſe deny Chriſt to be a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> a publick Perſon, and a Spiritual or Myſtical Root. 2. I would fain know whether Chriſt in his Humane Nature was not Elect, and the Head of all the Elect; therefore if we conſider him but ſingly, whether he was not the Principal Elect one? and I pray, was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with him or for him? I ſay it was made with him and for him, and ſo it was made with the Elect in him, both with them and for them; or elſe how comes God's Purpoſe and Grace to be given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. But you tell us that the Elect have nothing to do as a condition of this Covenant; you reckon, you highly honour Chriſt in giving all the Conditionality of this Covenant to him; and what's that? It's that he provided for our performing the condition of another Covenant, and why might he not have prepared us by that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for another Covenant condition after that? But it ſeems your Covenant of Redemption is but a ſubordinate Covenant to that of Grace, and its Righteouſneſs ſubordinate to our Righteouſneſs, which you make the condition of the Covenant of Grace.</p>

                           <p>It is true, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and other Learned Divines have ſpoken of a Covenant of Redemption, as in ſome reſpect diſtinct from the Covenant of Grace, but make not ſuch an ill Uſe of that Notion as you do: The Dr. ſays, <q>He doth not call theſe Foederaal Tranſactions the Covenant of Grace abſolutely: Nor
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56391:92"/> is it ſo called in Scripture. [And it may well be ſo, for we find not the Term Covenant of Grace mentioned in Scripture] and ſome will not diſtinguiſh between a Covenant of a Mediator, and the Covenant of Grace, becauſe the Promiſes of the Covenant are abſolutely ſaid to be made to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. of which ſome its plain the Aſſembly at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was.</q> And therefore it appears there have been different Apprehenſions in this matter. I reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both Parties as Orthodox and ſound in what they intended and meant in this Point; but I muſt adhere to the Word of God as the moſt infallible Guide in this and other things, according to what Light I receive. All the difference that I find they make, is no more than <hi>reſpectu adjunctorum,</hi> that is <hi>Hiddenneſs</hi> and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at moſt to <hi>Execution.</hi> And indeed all I underſtand by Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is two things:
<q>1. To ſhew us under how many Conſiderations the New Covenant comes. And, 2. Which of theſe Conſiderations it is the Spirit of God ſeems moſtly to point at, when it ſpeaks of this New Covenant, as a Promiſe, Covenant of Grace or Peace. And he ſaith, It's variouſly repreſented, 1. In the Deſignation and Preparation of its Terms and Benefits in the Councel of God, which although it have the nature of an eternal Decree, yet is it not the ſame with the Decree of Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. It may be conſidered with reſpect of the Foederal Tranſactions between the Father and the Son. 3. In reſpect of Declaration of it by Special Revelation. (1) By way of Abſolute Promiſe. (2) By way of Additional Preſcription of the way and means whereby it is the Will of God that we ſhould enter into a Covenant-ſtate with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The Covenant may be conſidered as to the actual Application of the Grace, Benefit and Priviledges unto any Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now all this while he makes not two Covenants, a Covenant of Redemption, and of Grace, but gives divers Conſiderations of the New Covenant in it's Diſpenſation, and under which Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it may moſt uſually and properly be termed by us a Covenant of Grace: And the ground of this Diſcourſe is to diſprove your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Covenant of Redemption or Surety ſhip is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſe of the Covenant of Grace: And he ſhews that it is no where ſaid in the Scripture, <q>That Chriſt by his Death me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, procured, obtained the New Covenant,<note place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>Now he comes to ſhew what reſpect the Covenant of Grace hath unto the Death of Chriſt, and what Influence it hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>

                                 <hi>A.</hi> Suppoſing what is ſpoken of his being a Surety thereof, it hath a three-fold reſpect thereunto. 1. In that the Covenant,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>O. p.</hi> 271, 272.</note> as to the Grace and Glory of it, were prepared in the Councel of God, as the Terms of it was fixed in the Covenant of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and as it were declared in the Promiſe, was confirmed, ratified, and made it revocable thereby. This the Apoſtle inſiſts on at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 2. He thereby underwent and performed all that which in the Righteouſneſs and Wiſdom of God was required, that the Effects, Fruits, Benefits and Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56391:93"/> and deſigned, and prepared in the New Covenant might be effectually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and communicated unto Sinners. 3. All the Benefits were procured by him, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Now ſaith he, The Sum of theſe things is, Whereas it's affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the New Covenant was procured by the Death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Dr. O. p. <hi>273.</hi>
                                 </note> if it be underſtood with reſpect unto the Actual Communication of all Grace and Glory prepared in the Covenant, and propoſed unto us in the Promiſes of it; it is moſt true, all the Grace and Glory promiſed in the Covenant was purchaſed for the Church by Jeſus Chriſt. In this fence by his Death he procured the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but as to the New Covenant it ſelf it's not procured.</p>
                           </q>

You ſay, it's a way ordained of God: Here's no <hi>Forma</hi> or <hi>Differentia;</hi> for many things are ways and means, which are not Covenants; you ſhould have ſaid (according to your Sence) it's God's Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Sinners upon Terms of Faith and Repentance. 3. The Application of the means effectually is part of the Salvation it ſelf. 4. You ſay this Salvation is prepared by Chriſt; you ſhould have ſaid, By the Father in his Councel and Purpoſe for the giving his Son, and bleſſing us with all Bleſſings in him: The Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is Chriſt, and in Chriſt; he is our Life; the Father hath given us Life, and this is in his Son. 5. You ſhould have ſaid, Which he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to enable the Elect to comply with, or elſe it hath nothing of a Covenant in it; it carries only the force of electing Will; and if he hath promiſed, then to ſome or other, either to Chriſt, and then it brings in your Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; if to any other excluding Chriſt, then to the Elect out of Chriſt: For the Promiſe to make a Perſon comply, muſt be made, and muſt be in Nature before he doth comply.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe I know them not ſpoken of any where as diſtinct Covenants. The Scripture of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. is a place wherein this Covenant is ſo clearly deſcribed between the Father and the Son, it holds forth the Covenant of Grace fully and clearly, the Promiſe of all Grace and Benefits that are contained in the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, That this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Agreement was the <hi>Will by which we are ſanctified, through the offering of the Body of Jeſus once for all,</hi> Heb. 10.8, 9, 10.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That Covenant that contains in it the whole Matter and Form, in Conditions and Promiſes, of the Covenant of Grace, doth not Eſſentially differ from it: but the Covenant of Redemption doth. It contains Conditions and Promiſes of Grace, all things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Life and Godlineſs; and it contains in it all conditions upon which we may be partakers of any Promiſes, Chriſt's Perſon, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Sacrifice, Righteouſneſs Active and Paſſive, there's no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant condition, of Atonement, Propitiation, Satisfaction unto the Juſtice of God, but it is here, Chriſt is the Great Fulfiller of the Law, and Satisfier of it; he is the <hi>End of the Law for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every Believer,</hi> Rom. 10.4.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. From the Vailed Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Chriſt, their Sacrifices, and their Ceremonial Adminiſtration held forth in a Figure, that it is made to Chriſt, and confirmed in him as the Great Offering, and Atonement; Chriſt is there exemplified and ſet forth as the fulneſs of the Covenant of Grace, both in reſpect of Promiſes and Conditions.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When we plead any thing of the Covenant of Grace, it's the Promiſes of Life made to us in Chriſt, as <hi>Yea and Amen</hi> to us in him, in reſpect of obtaining and performance to us.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Our Juſtifying Acts of Faith is fixed on Chriſt as the Summ of the Covenant of Grace, as Satisfying for our Sins, and as to whom the Promiſes were made, and the great thing promiſed, as the Fountain and Meritorious Cauſe of all Bleſſings; he is given us as the Covenant.</p>
                           <p n="6">
                              <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56391:94"/>6. There is all Grace to be had in this Covenant, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora;</hi> there is no Grace but is given forth and received by us in this Covenant between the Father and Son; the Gift of the Spirit, the Grace of Faith, Juſtification by his Blood; by him came all Grace; yea all other ſuppoſed Grace that came not from the Father, and through Chriſt, is no Grace, and will not profit us.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Where the Covenanters Condition and Promiſes are all from Grace and Love to us, there's a Covenant of Grace; but in that which you call a diſtinct Covenant of Redemption, the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Conditions and Promiſes are of Free Grace and Love to us; God the Father from his Free Grace and Love to us called his Son to this Undertaking and Covenanting with him; God the Son in our Perſon from his Love and Free Grace Covenanted with his Father, he came and freely offered himſelf to perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant condition. The condition of this Covenant in all Mediatorial Perfections and Performances, is freely promiſed and beſtowed upon us. The Promiſe of Eternal Life, all Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are promiſed and given, in this Covenant. That is a Covenant of Grace, wherein God is to us a God of all Grace.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. If the Covenant of Redemption be not the Covenant of Grace, then there is more Covenants than the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace for Life and Salvation, but there is no more Covenants for our Life and Salvation, but that of Works, and that of Grace. The <hi>Minor</hi> I think hardly any will deny; but if it be ſaid there was <hi>Moſes Mount Sinai</hi> Covenant; that was but a darker and faultier Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace in the Moral and Ceremonial Law; if Church Covenants be alledged under the Law or Goſpel, they add nothing to this grand Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but are Accompliſhments of the Promiſes thereof to whom it doth belong, it being promiſed that they ſhall be God's People; in this Covenant Chriſt ſtipulates, and we in him, as we did in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> then when we believe we ſtipulate, moved thereto from the Grace of the Promiſe, and enter perſonally into this Covenant, embracing that Covenant which was made for us in Chriſt, it's called laying hold of it. It is ſolemnly alſo owned, profeſſed and reſtipulated to, when we enter into Church Fellowſhip; repeated Reſtipulations, and Renewings of the ſame Covenant may be, without changing the Covenant; for as we find God often repeats this Covenant, and renews it with his People in Revelation and Eſtabliſhment, as with <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                              <pb n="128" facs="tcp:56391:95"/> yet it was but the ſame Covenant; ſo are God's Children excited and encouraged thereto from the Free Grace of the ſaid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall not here enlarge any further, but refer the Reader to that Excellent Treatiſe of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> concerning the Covenants; where <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 18. he gives us this account of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <q>
                              <p>The Covenant of Grace was made and eſtabliſhed not only with us, but jointly with Jeſus Chriſt, and us in him; ſo that both are within one and the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for the great Tranſactions with Jeſus, yea, even the giving and ſending of him, and his accepting the Office of a Redeemer, and undertaking for us, theſe are all of Grace as well as what is promiſed to us through him; therefore the Covenant of Grace muſt take in all that conduceth (otherwiſe than a meer Decree) to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration and Eternal Salvation.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. There is no Scripture Evidence for making theſe two Covenants, one of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip or Redemption with Jeſus Chriſt, and another of Grace and Reconciliation made with us; that diſtinction which ſome uſe is improper, for the parts are coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſeeing that which was with Chriſt was of meer Grace alſo, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. And it's promiſed that he ſhould be given for a Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. therefore it's of <hi>Grace we are Redeemed by him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. There was Grace before the World was, and that muſt be in the Covenant as with Jeſus Chriſt, which was for Reconciling the <hi>VVorld to the Father,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. Coloſ. 1.20, 21. It's true, Chriſt only is our Redeemer and Surety, not we in our own Perſons, — And Chriſt hath ſome peculiar Precepts and Promiſes appropriated to him, which are not afforded to us in the ſame manner and degree, yet this hindereth not the Oneneſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him and us.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Grace was made with Jeſus Chriſt as a Publick Perſon, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore with all his Seed in him.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. All in the Covenant as with us, is undertaken for and promiſed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as between the Father and the Son, and ſo together make but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. All Covenant Bleſſings are primarily granted to Chriſt. See more, p. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> was a worthy Man; but it may be not without ſome Hay and Stubble. I wiſh it do not prove an attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting at another Foundation beſides Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                           <p>You tell us, what an antecodent condition is; that it ſignifies no
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56391:95"/> more than an Act of ours, and ſuch is Faith. I ſuppoſe you and he mean, in diſtinction from a conſequent condition: The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gains the Eſtate; the Lawyers reckon it the Purchaſe-Mony, the conſequent condition keeps it, and it's the Quit-rent, which if it be not duly paid, the Lord can enter and take to the Eſtate: So that Faith you'll have to be the Antecedent condition money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited and laid down, before you have any thing of your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eſtate. And you ſay, it ſignifies no more than an Act of ours. I pray, whoſe ſhould it be but ours, if the condition be to be performed by us? And why is this put in, <hi>it ſignifies no more?</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the meaning be, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſhould be ſhut out, and it ſhould be reckoned under the nature of this condition meerly as an Act of ours, without reſpect to Chriſt the Author of it, and Chriſt the true Object of it. And now you tell us it's Negative Qualifications. 1. It's not perfect in every degree. What's the meaning of that? This inſinuates as if it were perfect in ſome degrees. I had thought no Grace were perfect in degrees, tho' as to Kind and Truth. But you will have it perfect in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and imperfect in other degrees: Pray in what degrees is this condition perfect, and in what imperfect? And whether it be not an imperfect Covenant that hath an imperfect Condition? 2. It's not in the leaſt meritorious of the Benefits conferred, by no means, <hi>i. e.</hi> by any Intrinſick Value and Worth, either adequate to, or excelling the Benefits received. No, your meaning is, what you have for it is well worth your Money; it's a good Bargain: But by your Favour, every Foederal Condition is <hi>ex pacto,</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; ſo that you may challenge your Bargain upon Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, if it be but 20 Guineas to purchaſe an 100 <hi>l. per Annum:</hi> So that we have only your Word for it, that it's not meritorious, when it's ſo in reality; the nature of the thing ſpeaks it to the Underſtanding of all Men of Sence. No, no; do not think to wheedle Chriſt out of his Merits, and God out of the Honour of his Free-Grace, and us out of the comfort of both. 3. You ſay it's not performed in our Natural Strength. No, and yet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Covenant made with Man? A moſt unreaſonable thing, to require a Condition of a Covenant of one, that we know hath no ſtrength to perform it. If a rich Man ſhould offer an Eſtate of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a year to a poor Man that he knew was not worth a Groat, provided he fetched him Twenty Pound of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; this Act would be reckoned a mocking and ridiculing this poor Wretch. God did not require that ſmall Condition of <hi>Adam,</hi> but that he actually had natural Strength to perform it.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56391:96"/> You will ſay, God will give him Ability to perform, ſo he did to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> previous to the Covenant. As the rich Man tells the poor, I will give thee 20 <hi>l.</hi> to pay me for my Eſtate, he'll ſay, Well, Sir, when you give it me, I will then bargain with you; and when I have it, though you gave it me, I ſhall reckon it mine as much as if I had raiſed it my ſelf, or another had given; and if we bargain, I ſhall expect to have my Bargain upon this condition. Though it's a good Bargain, yet it's a Bargain, and whatever I have of you is Debt. I can ſue for it as purchaſed by me, ſaith the poor Man. Now ſee how well qualified this Condition is; no, no, believe it, God makes no ſuch lame Bargains as theſe: Yet you ſay, <hi>according to the Conſtitution of the Covenant, it is required of us in order to the Bleſſings conſequent thereupon by vertue of the Promiſe.</hi> This I muſt confeſs is an Orthodox Paradox indeed. What mean you by the Conſtitution of the Covenant? Is it not as other Covenants, by the Conſtitution of your Scheme? Is it not by a Condition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? And is not this Condition performed <hi>Foederale Meritum?</hi> And is not, <hi>Do this and Live, Ordo foederalis,</hi> and the Bleſſings conſequent <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and therefore Debt? Think not to beat us out of our Senſes, that the Bleſſings of a Covenant are only <hi>à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentia Ordinis vel poſterioritatis:</hi> As one Man follows another in a narrow Path, or <hi>Ordine Naturae,</hi> as a Son is after a Father: But here it is <hi>in Ordine ad, Virtute pacti,</hi> in order to a Foederal Right and Challenge of the Benefits as a due Debt. But how do you underſtand that Clauſe, <hi>By vertue of the Promiſe?</hi>

                              <hi>It's from God's Will in the Promiſe, that they are made to be Conditions: He connected the Benefit and the Duty; though he choſe thoſe Conditions that were fit, yet their fitneſs would not have availed to our Intereſt in the Benefits, unleſs he had promiſed that they ſhould avail.

                           <p>Wherefore God's Will in the Promiſe? Are not the Promiſe and the Conditions both equally willed by God? Is God's Will in the Promiſe any thing beſides that Will of God that is in the Condition? The plain Truth is, this is a puzzling Doctrine, God's Will in the Promiſe that makes Conditions. But how? You tell us, he connected Benefit and Duty. But in what manner? For he connected Benefit and Duty in the Covenant of Works; and it was as much God's Will in the Promiſe as you can pretend to, if I underſtand the Riddle: But you ſay, he choſe fit Conditions. It was fit God ſhould chooſe his Conditions, and it became his Wiſdom and Power to make fit Conditions: But imperfect, lame,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56391:96"/> ſinful Conditions of a Covenant do not become a holy and perfect God to chooſe; to caſt away perfect Conditions, and take Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their room. But though God <hi>choſe fit Conditions,</hi> yet they <hi>would not have availed,</hi> (ſufficient, you reckon, but not efficient) God's choice of Perſons or things in your Sence, makes them not certainly future; yet we find that many things that God hath choſen do avail to attain the End to which he choſe them, tho' there be no Promiſe of their availing. But it ſeems God makes a Covenant with Man, and is fain to enter into Bond for Man's Performance of the Condition, and perform them himſelf at laſt in giving the firſt Grace. But what indeed ſhould be the true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, after all this Splutter about a Condition? It's but a little thing wrapt up in the Promiſe, and is ours by vertue of Promiſe. So that at laſt our conditional Covenant is become Abſolute; for we have the Duty as well as the Benefit by Promiſe. The Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believer hath his Faith and Repentance as a part of eternal Life given to him by Promiſe.</p>

You bid poor Sinners come and buy; and you ſay not with the Prophet, <hi>without money and price,</hi> but you muſt have ſuch a parcel of Mony to do it with, which Money is in God's Hands. They will tell you, when God gives us the Money, we will buy, and till then it's not our Fault. He is a hard Maſter if he looks to reap where he ſowed not.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56391:97"/> and had antecedent Power given him to perform? Is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to command the performance of a condition, where the Commander knows there is no Power to perform? Is it conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God to command an Impoſſibility to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a Covenant-condition? And is it juſt to deal with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Non-performance, according to the Sanction of a Law? And you ſay, <hi>His Duty no leſs by being made Terms,</hi> &amp;c.

It's Grace to take his Creature into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Angels are ſaved by Grace, and ſo would Man have been, if he had ſtood; and though he fell, there was that Grace you ſpeak of in giving Ability to perform the condition, and giving it before he put the condition upon him, which is not here; for you'll have the condition put upon a Sinner, before the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace to give him Ability; which makes it a harſh dealing, and unreaſonable, and hence far from Grace, and therefore this enjoyning makes not only leſs Grace, but no Grace.</p>

And is not the State of Believers decided in this Life? But is it ſtill a contingent Axiom that <hi>John</hi> a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56391:97"/> true Believer ſhall be ſaved? What miſerable conſequences will hence be inferr'd, the conditions are ſtill performing theſe Federal Conditions and Subjective Qualifications, it may be the Man may not perform them all, and then he periſheth Eternally; there's no certainty of Salvation here, no Man can have any more than an Opinion of it, ſhake hands with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> Nay hence it ſeems that all the Grace given here is no part of Eternal Life, but qualifying conditions to make them meet for it Federally, and that in true Engliſh is to make them merit it.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56391:98"/> Men by the Works of this Law, and treats all the World as redeemed Subjects, deals with them according to this new Law, bringing them upon their Tryal for Eternity.

It's enough for his Prieſtly Office, that it merited what he was to do as King: But not all; for the firſt Grace muſt not come from his Merits; and now there's but a little Uſe for his Prieſthood; all the reſt depend upon our Conditions.</p>

I would wiſh you to build a Condition-School, where all Perſons might reſort to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition-Lectures, to ſit them to underſtand your Terms of Art in Preaching: And let us conſider a little the Nature of it. Condition comes under ſeveral Conſiderations.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Logical; and there it's <hi>Conditio conditionans,</hi> or <hi>Conditio conditionata.</hi> It's <hi>more Ordinis, aut Relationis, reſpectu Ordinis;</hi> It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a Priority and Poſteriority of things: All things can't be at once, but one thing muſt be before another; and here one thing is the condition of another <hi>reſpectu temporis;</hi> there is <hi>Conditio relativa;</hi> and ſo all Arguments are mutual Conditions one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſiſt <hi>è mutuâ alterius affectione;</hi> and here is not <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritas temporis ſed nature Pater eſt conditio Filii;</hi> or rather, <hi>Paternitas relata affectio eſt cauſa filietatis correlata affectionis.</hi> There is <hi>Conditio Axiomatica,</hi> which ariſeth from a Contingent Axiom, or neceſſary; and either connex, becauſe they're moſtly expreſs'd <hi>Conjunctione connexivâ ſi.</hi> And ſo there is alſo <hi>Conditio in diſpoſitione Syllogiſticâ, ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendentia inter concluſiones &amp; premiſſa.</hi> There is alſo Law-Conditions. Dr. <hi>Cawel</hi> ſaith, It is a Rate, Manner, or Law annexed to Men's Acts or Grants, ſtaying and ſuſpending the ſame, and making them uncertain whether they ſhall take effect or no. And <hi>Papinian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Conditio dicitur cum quid in caſum incertum, qui poteſt tendere ad eſſe aut non eſſe confertur.</hi> This is a general Account of a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ariſing out of a Contingency, the effect depending upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56391:98"/> an uncertain Cauſe. And a Learned Lawyer ſaith, A Condition is a Reſtraint or Bridle annexed and joyned to a Promiſe, by the performance of which it's ratifyed and takes effect, and by the Non-performance of it becomes void.</p>
                           <p>Such a Condition I perceive you and Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> will have Faith to be; a Condition upon which the Promiſe is made, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſuſpended by the Diſpoſer till the ſaid Condition be performed. <hi>Conditio adimpleri debet priuſque ſequatur effectus.</hi> Now this being your Condition, I ſay, it's Foederal. It's <hi>Conditio Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis;</hi> and let it be in value leſs or more, it makes a Covenant of Works, and is cloathed with all the Logical Notions of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides. The Logical Conditions are in all things <hi>ex neceſſitate dependentiae mutuae rerum,</hi> and a Man can't move a Hand or Tongue without them. Even Brutes and all inanimate Beings, as well as Men, they belong to the whole Fabrick and Conſtitution of created Beings. But a Foederal Condition belongs only to rational Beings; and it's related to the Promiſe <hi>ex pacto,</hi> in a way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Promiſe belongs to it by way of Debt. And in this Sence the Apoſtle always decries the Law, or any Law, to have to do with our Juſtification; he affirms, that it's always of Grace, and never of Debt, upon the leaſt Conſideration whatever of our Performance and Qualification.</p>
                           <p>And this is the Condition that I contend againſt, and ſay,</p>
                           <p>That neither Faith, or any other Gracious Qualifications or Graces of the Spirit, are Foederal Conditions, or Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. My Arguments, ſome of them in brief are theſe.</p>
                           <p>That which is a Gift of the Promiſe of eternal Life, is no condition of it; but Faith is a gift of the Promiſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the <hi>Major,</hi> it's clear; for one thing can't be another <hi>eodem reſpectu &amp; tempore.</hi> The Condition and Promiſe are <hi>Oppoſita;</hi> they are <hi>Foederalia relata,</hi> and therefore <hi>Contraria affirmantia;</hi> a Father can't be a Son in that reſpect as he is a Father. As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> it's out of all doubt by Divine Teſtimony. See <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. To know Chriſt by Faith, is Eternal Life; and this Life of Faith is the Gift of God. Hence Faith, that is the Benefit promiſed, is not the condition of it. A Promiſe, or Gift of the Promiſe, cannot be the Condition of it ſelf.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That which would make the Promiſe a Debt, and the Gift of it a Reward of Debt, is not to be allowed: But to make Faith a Foederal Condition of the Covenant of Grace, would make the Promiſe to be Debt, and the Reward a Reward of Debt.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56391:99"/> Therefore Faith is not to be allowed to be a Condition of the Covenant. For the <hi>Major,</hi> it will ſtand with invincible ſtrength from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Divinity and Logick, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. Believing and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are oppoſed as working and not working, as <hi>Contradicentia.</hi> It's vain and frivolous to ſhift by evaſive Interpretations; and all that's ſaid to that purpoſe, is eaſily wip'd off. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> That putting Faith in as a Federal condition, would make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Debt. The Performance of any Work, or doing any Act as a Federal Condition, let it be never ſo ſmall, the promiſing Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator becomes indebted thereby to beſtow the Benefit promiſed on the Confoederator, <hi>ex obligatione foederali,</hi> and therefore a Debtor. Now the Apoſtle will not allow any thing of this in the leaſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <note place="margin">In thoſe places where the Apoſtle oppoſeth Faith to Works he ſpeaks of ſuch Works as contain perfect and perpetual Obedience, ſuch as God required of man under the Law, but not of thoſe Works which comprehend that Obedience which God requires of us who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt <hi>Racov. Catech.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi> Therefore your Doctrine of Conditions is <hi>Socin.</hi>
                              </note>3. That Doctrine which will make all the Graces of Sanctification or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualifications, Federal Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is not to be admitted. But to ſay, Faith is a condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Sence pleaded for, will bring in all other Graces as well as it's ſelf, <hi>Ergo</hi> this Doctrine is not to be admitted; for there is as much reaſon that all of them be allowed to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as that Faith ſhould; and therefore I ſee you and your Party bring in Repentance and other Graces together with Faith; and ſay, Our eternal Life is given unto us at the laſt, upon conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Meetneſs for it. But the Scripture no where ſpeaks of our Juſtification, for or by Repentunce, Love, Patience, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not ſo much as once in the Sence that it ſpeaks of Juſticfiation by Faith: And therefore Faith juſtifies not in it's qualifying nature, which it hath in common with other Graces of the Spirit. God never intended our ſtricteſt Holineſs and higheſt degrees of Grace ſhould be our Juſtifying Righteouſneſs before God, or Federal Conditions of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That any Act of ours ſhould be a Federal Condition of the Covenant of Grace, deſtroys the very Nature of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6. Eph. 2.8, 9. Tit. 2.5. Rom. 5.17, 18. Iſa. 55.1, 2. 1 Cor. 2.12. Rom. 3.24.</note> as it ſtands in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Covenant of Works; it can't be diſtinguiſhed otherwiſe from the Covenant of Works; for the Condition of the Covenant of Works was as ſmall as any thing, imagining the Ability was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56391:99"/> given before the Condition was required. He ſhould have had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Grace in the Promiſe, had he outſtood this Temptation. Now the formal difference between the Covenant of Works, and Grace was in the Condition, that in the Covenant of Works the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which was the Condition was in Man himſelf that was to be Juſtified. In the Covenant of Grace the conditional Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is in another: Not only the Promiſe, but the Condition is freely given, and is in another. If we muſt provide the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay, if it muſt be inherent in us, though wrought by God, it makes our Covenant-ſtanding no otherwiſe than the firſt and old Covenant-ſtanding. Beſides, the Deſign of God in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is not only to ſave graciouſly, ſo he doth ſave Elect Angels, but to ſave mercifully; to take them into Covenant with him, that not only are without good Qualifications, but ſuch as are moſt ſinful and miſerable, and not to qualifie them with meriting or dignifying Righteouſneſs firſt, but to ſave them ſo, that neither they themſelves, nor God himſelf, will ſee any Federal Conditions of Righteouſneſs in them. The deſign of Grace is to ſave the Creature in the higheſt Degree of Abaſement in himſelf, and far from boaſting, or ſeeing any reaſon in himſelf to do it.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The great and Evangelical Promulgations of this Covenant of Grace was always in abſolute Promiſes, and no mention made of Federal Conditions in us. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20.

Repentance owns our Filth and Guilt, and Faith in a Redeemer expreſſeth our ſinful and loſt Eſtate; neither of theſe could have place in our Legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as being utterly inconſiſtent with an Innocent condition: Nor can they have much Room in Heaven, where we ſhall be perfect, whereas the Terms of the Covenant of Works implied nothing but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Happineſs.</hi>

                           <p>You tell us of Faith and Repentance being the Principal condition; I pray which are the reſt of the conditions, it's fit we ſhould know them all, and when we have performed our part that we make our claim, for we can make none till we have performed all. 2. If our Repentance only as a condition expreſs Guilt and Filth, it expreſſeth our Condemnation only, and thereby not a condition of Salvation; it worketh Wrath, and thereby belongs to the Law of <hi>Works broken, Rom.</hi> 4.15. If it be a condition of Salvation it muſt take off Guilt and Filth by Expiation, which you dare not ſay Repentance doth make; and ſo Faith, it's not enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a ſinful and loſt Eſtate; that's but a Sentence of Death, but it muſt as a condition take off this Sentence, by its own Nature. 3. Whereas you ſay neither of theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith or Repentance could have place in our Legal Righteouſneſs; it's falſe, for Faith had place in our Legal Righteouſneſs. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was Faith and Obedience, and his Legal unrighteouſneſs was begun in Unbelief, which is manifeſt from the Serpents Temptation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. which <hi>Adam</hi> complyed with; our Firſt Parents fell firſt by Unbelief. And why could not Repentance have been one of the conditions, if the Law-giver had pleaſed to put it in? Why might not the Law run in theſe Terms, <hi>In the day thou eateſt, and doſt not repent thereof, thou ſhalt die,</hi> and ſo one Law ſhould have done all? Why could there not have been as many conditions, and the ſame in the Old Law as you will have in the New? therefore there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders in the Nature of the thing that makes it inconſiſtent, as you ſay, with an Innocent condition; why may not a proviſion be made in a ſtate of Innocency for the cure of Nocency, if the Legiſlator pleaſeth?

The Apoſtle condemns a faulty Covenant, but you chuſe to prefer a Covenant that is faulty, made up of ſinful Obedience, and that muſt have a Mediator to provide againſt it, and to mend the faults of it; and hence this Covenant could not be without a Mediator, becauſe of its faultineſs; and you ſay your Covenant makes us capable of no Happineſs but what was bought and prepared for us. 1. Then this is a Covenant that capacitates us firſt for what Chriſt bought, and then when we are capable we ſhall be partakers of Chriſt, by a previous Covenant where Chriſt hath nothing to do but Extrinſecally only; this capability is by congruity or condignity. 2. It's a kindneſs to Chriſt that you will allow him the honour to buy and prepare Happineſs for us, and have it ready againſt we have occaſion for it. 3. What other kind of Happineſs can you ſuppoſe? Is there any but what comes to us in or by Chriſt? Would the Life promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> have differed in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and be of another kind? But is not the Gift of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56391:102"/> Son himſelf a Happineſs?

But his Blood is the Price of all, there's enough for him, he bought your whole New Law at a Lump, both your Inherent Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Righteouſneſs for a condition, and the Reward of Debt; he capacitated the Law, and brought it to ſo low Terms, that you were capable of performing the conditions of it.

And what if the Happineſs granted to a Sinleſs Obedience came immediately from the Creator, was it the worſe for it, provided it were the ſame Happineſs, and knew no Atonement? (you ſay) why? becauſe it needed none. But it might know a Mediator, though no Atonement; a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may be where there's no Atonement. What did the Tree of Life import? Laſtly, I would fain know whether Chriſt, and all the Goſpel Bleſſings, come not immediately from God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?

                           <p>It ſeems that God may make his Reward to be of Grace, he throws away the ſinleſs condition, and blends up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with Sin; is this the way for Grace to abound, to make Sin a Sharer in the Foederal Condition, yea, and Damnation too, a ſinful, imperfect Condemnable Condition; the Covenant of Grace is to ſave from Sin and Damnation, not by Sin and for Damnation. And is there not a Reward of Debt, if a Man purchaſe an Eſtate with Braſs Half Crowns, Waſht and Clipt Money, if they be accepted, as well as if he paid in good Currant Money? It ſeems now God's willing to take your Copper Money, he ſhall have the Credit of giving you an Eſtate; I tell you, if Copper Money will paſs, it makes as clear Debts and Purchaſes as Silver and Gold. But I muſt ſay this is but waſht Divinity, and clipt too; and there's no part of it but is filthily mixt at beſt.</p>

All that you have ſaid is ſo far from turning your Law of Imperfection into a Covenant of Works, that it proves it to be a Covenant of Works againſt all the World. What God can do is one thing, and will do is another. I am ſure he hath made no other Foederal Condition of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, than Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his Righteouſneſs; and when the Judgment Day is come, and it may be through Grace before, during the ſtate of Tryal, as you call it, you will be glad to throw away all your conditions, and hold Chriſt alone as the only Foederal condition of Life and Salvation.</p>
                           <p>And let me tell you again, that you forget it not:</p>
                           <p>That God never promiſed or applyed any Benefit to the moſt Perfect and Innocent Creature, upon the condition of any Action he commands, but what he freely enableth the ſaid Perſon ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to perform; and hitherto you have given us no Specifick difference between the Covenant of Works and Grace, it's only in degree that this is worſe in condition, and we are all together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength to perform it.</p>

                           <p>A. The Grace of God is manifeſted in the Second Covenant, in that he freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth and offereth to Sinners a Mediator, and Life and Salvation by him, requiring Faith as the condition to Intereſt them in him, promiſeth and giveth his Holy Spirit to all his Elect, to work in them that Faith with all other Saving Graces.</p>

                           <p>In the firſt place you ſhould have obſerved that they ſpeak only of the manifeſtation of the Grace of the Covenant, and no diſtinct Covenant from that of Redemption. 2. They make not Faith a Condition of the Covenant of Grace, but only of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Reception or Participation of the ſaid Covenant. With them 'tis no more than <hi>modus recipiendi,</hi> or <hi>participandi,</hi> which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called the Inſtrument, and therefore explain themſelves thus:</p>
                           <p>Queſt. 73. <hi>How doth Faith juſtifie a Sinner in the ſight of God?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>A.</hi> Not as if Works, or any Grace of Faith, or any Act thereof were imputed to him for his Juſtification, but only as it is an Inſtrument whereby he receiveth and applyeth Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. 3. I made no Queſtion but that it was that Fly that you catch'd at, and watch'd for. The Word <hi>Condition</hi> was then but a very ſmall inconſiderable Word, that none made any great matter of, as importing no more than the Connexion of the Congregrative connex Axiom, whoſe band of Connexion is the Conjunction <hi>Si:</hi> And this conditional Connexion may fall upon any things that have neceſſary or contingent dependency one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, whereby they have a mutual Affection or Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one to another, and I call it a relative Condition, and all things may come under it which way ſoever they look. The Affirmation of this Propoſition, <hi>Si ſit homo eſt animal.</hi> If the Antecedent be true, then the Conſequence is true. If <hi>John</hi> be a Man, then he is an Animal, and the Negation is, <hi>Non ſi Johannes ſit homo ſit animal;</hi> and though both antecedent and conſequent may be falſe, yet the It may be a true Propoſition by vertue of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. As if a Man be a Lyon, he is a Four-footed Beaſt. So if <hi>Judas</hi> be ſaved, he did believe. It's a true Propoſition; tho' <hi>Judas</hi> never did believe, nor was ſaved; neither was there any Covenant of Grace made with him. So that ſuch a Propoſition as this importeth no Covenant-Condition, unleſs it be foederal over and above. If the Devils ſhall be ſaved, Chriſt died for them. It's true as a connex Propoſition, becauſe there's <hi>no other Name given under Heaven by which any Sinner can be ſaved.</hi> But neither parts of this Propoſition is true, for Chriſt died not for them, nor ſhall they be ſaved. So here, if a Sinner partake of Chriſt, it's by Believing, becauſe believing is his Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and giving and receiving are <hi>relata,</hi> and is no more a Condition here, than Faith is to Holineſs. As thus, If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall bring forth Fruits of Faith, and it will be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the other way, if I bring forth good Fruits, then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. So that this ſort of Condition attends the Expreſſion of all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56391:104"/> ſorts of Relations and Dependencies, either Logical, Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Natural or Theological. But when the Word <hi>Condition</hi> is carried further, to denote a Foederal Bond or Obligation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a big-bellied Word (as you have phraſed it) and is always a diſtinguiſhing Character of a Covenant of Works. And that the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> intended no other than a Relative Condition, not a Federal, I can give you many grounds from themſelves.</p>

                           <p>They by Intereſt mean Claim of Intereſt and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, which we have by Faith; and there Faith is no more a Condition, than my hand is to the receiving a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> When it's brought, it's only a Relative Condition: Where there's giving there is receiving; but if there be any Condition on one ſide more than another, it's in the giving ſide, which in nature and cauſality hath the firſt place: For it runs thus, If you receive, there's ſome body gives: So the Giving is the Condition of Receiving. Or ſee it thus, If you be a Father, you have a Son; they are mutual Cauſes one of another, but the Father is firſt in reſpect of Nature and Cauſality. If Receiving lie upon the Condition of Giving, then Receiving is not the Condition of Giving, but <hi>vice verſa:</hi> but Receiving lies under, and depends upon the Condition of Giving; for if there be no Giving, there can be no Receiving.</p>

But now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant.</hi> And what is this better Covenant?

The Condition on God's Part, <hi>They ſhall live.</hi> The Condition on Man's Part, <hi>That he might live, he muſt do this.</hi> And in the Old Covenant, in caſe Man failed, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was broke: But in this Covenant there's no Condition on Man's part to be performed, becauſe the <hi>Covenant is everlaſting,</hi> Heb. 8.

                                 <p>Obj. 1. <hi>There are many Conditions mentioned in this Covenant, there muſt be a Law put in the Mind, writ in the Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

You ſhall ſee plainly, that Man hath no tie upon him to perform any thing whatſoever in this Covenant as a Condition to be obſerved on his part— Mark how it is in <hi>Jer. Ezek. Heb.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>I will put it in, I will write it; they ſhall be my People. [Shall]</hi> here is a Word of Power. And it follows, <hi>They ſhall not teach every one his Neighbour. —for they ſhall know me.</hi> How? By their own Study and Induſtry. No. See <hi>John</hi> 6.45.

How will you anſwer the Preaching another Goſpel than <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, and free your ſelves from the <hi>Anathema?</hi> But ſecondly, If a Man that hath purchaſed an Eſtate for me, and left me an Hundred Pound to pay of the Purchaſe Money, I reckon that I pay part as well as he, though he paid a Thouſand Pound, and ſo will all Men judge. 3. It's not enough for you to ſay, Chriſt only paid the Price, when Foederal Conditions beſides lyes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome others; and we do as confidently affirm, and do prove, that where there is a Covenant ſtipulated by conditions and promiſes, the performance of the conditions, though never ſo ſmall and diſproportionable to the Benefit, carries a Merit of a Reward as of Debt, <hi>virtute pacti,</hi> though it lye not in the Intrinſick Value of the Condition, whether it be mine, or imputed to me by Loan or Gift, to buy the Benefit, or Swop for it.

One incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable one that hath ten times more Sin and Imperfection in it than Good? And whether this Covenant of Imperfection doth not look upon the Imperfecteſt Conditions, and moſt ſinful, provided there's a little good in them, to be the beſt Conditions? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fit that we ſhould have good, ſound and perfect Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for debas'd Coin?</p>

                           <p>It is as much as to ſay that Duty is no beneficial part of the Covenant; the change of the Heart is no beneficial part of the Covenant; but you ſay theſe beneficial parts are ſuſpended upon the Terms of Duty. It's as much as to ſay he ſhall have no Benefit by the Covenant, and all Benefits are ſuſpended till he do ſome Duty that is no Benefit of the Covenant. And as to your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, Whether God forbear to pardon us till we believe: I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Pardon is with God before it is with us, if it were not we ſhould never have it; and the Pardoning Grace of God is at work with us before we do believe, and doth by the Light of it in the Glorious Goſpel work Faith in our Hearts. As for your phraſing it thus, that God forbears Pardoning till we Believe, it inſinuates thus much according to your Scheme of Conditions, That God ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends his Acts toward the Creature till he ſeeth ſomething in it to encourage him, and that God would have wrought ſooner than he did, if it had not been our fault; whereas God works, and none can let, neither doth his working, or not working, depend upon the Creatures, but that it is in his own way and time, and when he will pardon he works Faith; and it muſt be ſo, becauſe the Believer is Pardoned in application of Pardon, therefore the Pardoner and Pardoned are <hi>relata;</hi> and though as <hi>relata</hi> they are <hi>ſimul natura,</hi> yet in reſpect of Cauſality the Pardoner is firſt; and if he ſhould forbear pardoning till the Sinner were fit for it by good qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would be long enough before it come unto us. You ſay the firſt Grace is abſolute, and if the ſecond Grace or Benefit be Conditional foederally, where lies the condition? and if a man be fallen into a deep Well, and have broken an Arm or Leg, would it not be very odd to ſay, I forbear the Setting of his Arm or Leg till he comes out of the Ditch, whereas it lyes upon me to fetch him out of the Ditch firſt. As God pardons who and when he pleaſeth, ſo by the ſame
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56391:109"/> Grace he hath provided for all ways and means of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Where are there Conditions through Grace to be wrought in us before the effectual Power of Grace? To ſay any thing is to be performed through Grace, that is not the Gift of Grace, and is not a Benefit of the Covenant, is ſomething; otherwiſe your Conditions are but in order of working, or at moſt Relative Conditions, the connexion of one Gift of Grace or Benefit to another, and then your conditionality is no more than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.

                           <p>It's one thing to be antecedently neceſſary, another thing to be conſequently neceſſary. Whatever is commanded in the Covenant of Grace (as you will inſinuate) is alſo promiſed; and being promiſed, is a Benefit: Therefore if you make believing antecedently neceſſary (which is a Work and Gift of Grace) to all the Benefits, you contradict your ſelf and all right Reaſon. And as to the great Ado you make about Intereſt, I have told you it comes under a double conſideration, of real and known, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. All the Elect have a real Right and Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant even before believing, ſuch a Right as entitles them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: For Chriſt hath undertaken, that all that the Father hath given him ſhall come to him; and it's therefore abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they ſhould, as promiſed in the Covenant, not as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a leading Benefit, and no otherwiſe. And do you not call
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56391:109"/> them Saving Benefits? Shew me a Condition to be performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſaving Benefits that we do receive, and then you will ſay ſomething. What's a greater Benefit than Life it ſelf?</p>

                              <hi>Each of the Benefits of the Covenant are offered to Men on Condition, and not abſolutely in relation to God as his People is. So</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 36.3, 12. compared with 2 Cor. 6.16. Matth. 22.2, 3, 9, 10, 11. Rom. 10.9. ch. 4.25. Gal. 3.7.</p>

                           <p>Your Argument is very confuſed and rough drawn; for you tell us not what you would conclude of all the previous Queſtions. I take it for grant, that you would conclude your imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conditions in whatever Queſtion you put about the Covenant. 2. Then you uſe very ambiguous Terms; you talk of offering the benefits of a Covenant: It's one thing to make a Covenant, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to offer to make a Covenant; for there are conditions to the Offer, and the conditions to the making, and what you mean by offering abſolutely in relation to God, I know not. Doth not God offer abſolutely? Is he provoked to offer Grace from any thing out of himſelf? Sure he offers abſolutely and from himſelf, though he offer upon condition, or makes Conditions in his Offer: And how that comes in, <hi>as his People is,</hi> I know not. I take the whole put together not to be Sence. But I will extract your Argument as well as I can.</p>
                           <p>If each Benefit of the Covenant is offered to Men upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not abſolutely in relation to God, then there are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the Covenant of Grace to be performed by us before we can have the Benefits: But each Benefit of the Covenant is offered ſo, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi> Here I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> firſt; for there are conditions of Offer, and conditions propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Offer; mean them if you pleaſe: God's propounding the Grace of the Covenant-condition, is no ground of Proof, that therefore there are conditions to be performed by us before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Benefit: For the Duty required, and Good thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, are but both of them Benefits, and the leading Duty it may be the greateſt, and the greateſt Exemplification of the Grace of the Promiſe. Here is connexion then of Benefits as to Relation and Order, and therefore I deny your conſequence, That Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes conditionally made do inferr neceſſarily foederal conditions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56391:110"/> from the Benefits. <hi>Minor</hi> alſo deny'd; for each Benefit of the Covenant is not offered conditionally; as the making a new Heart, the Gift of Faith, the uniting Power and Efficacy of the Spirit, whereby we are inſerted into Chriſt as our Root, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can bring forth the Fruit of Faith. As to the places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I ſay, Firſt, That the Covenant of Grace as diſpenſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, was vailed and covered two ways. 1. By Types and Ceremonies. 2. By a Legal Miniſtration in Denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, Conditions, Promiſes of Temporal Bleſſings, whereby they were carried on to Duty; but yet in the Sacrifices they had ſome ſight by Faith of the Abſoluteneſs and Freeneſs of the Grace of God in the Promiſe; and it's evident the unconditionality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, tho' it was manifeſted ſometimes to the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet was moſtly under a Cloud; as in a cloudy day the Sun may now and then break out with marvellous Brightneſs and Splendor, when for the generality a Legal Darkneſs clouded and obſcured the Grace of God.</p>
                           <p>In other Ages the Myſtery of the Covenant was not made known and revealed ſo as now, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. But as to <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.3, 12 it makes nothing againſt us; for God doth but by his Commands and Promiſes bring them into participation of the Covenant of Grace. For what is Faith and Obedience but the Gifts of his Grace? And it's he who through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant <hi>works in us the things that are well-pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 13.21. And this was the way of his working with them, being under this Tutorage, differing little from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants till the time appointed of his Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 4. And accordingly you ſee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.3. the Promiſe of Encouragement is, <hi>Then will I give you rain in due ſeaſon.</hi> And likewiſe as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth outward Bleſſings, ſo Spiritual Priviledges, <hi>His Ordinances and Preſence among them,</hi> in them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Not that their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Statutes was the condition of his being a God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for he choſe them before they choſe him. And God ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. notwithſtanding theſe conditional Promiſes, <hi>I am the Lord your God that brought you out,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe as the Promiſes were moſtly of outward good things Temporal, and the continuance of his Ordinances, ſo performance of theſe were connected to their external Conformity to his inſtituted Worſhip; they were to be a ſeparate and peculiar People, ſequeſtred from other People unto his pure Worſhip and Ordinances; and to that Sence doth the Apoſtle apply this place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. For he preſſeth Purity in Church-fellowſhip in the foregoing Verſes by divers Arguments;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56391:110"/> and among others, this of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> That God expected ſuch Purity of the Church of the Old Teſtament, much more of them; and hence preſſeth Separation in external Church-fellowſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and then as they have the Bleſſings of Ordinances, they will have the Bleſſing of God's Viſible Preſence: Whereas I ſaid before, Benefits are connected. A Duty Benefit to a Priviledge, to be as motives to Performance, the Spirit working with the Word: There may be Commands, Directions, Motives to Duty in the Word, and none of theſe make Duty antecedently neceſſary and conditional to our being in Covenant, but all conſequently neceſſary, being a Series of connected Benefits flowing in after we are taken in to Covenant.</p>
                           <p>As to <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.2, 3, 9, 10, 11. you ſay, Coming to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Supper was a Condition of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhare in it,<note place="margin">You ſay in your Preface to that place, that the Garment is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith: You ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Putting on the Garment</hi> is the Garment. Is the coming to Chriſt, or putting him on, the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Garment, or Chriſt himſelf and his Righteouſneſs?</note> ſo is it of pardon of Sin and acceptance to Life. Coming to the Wedding-Supper was not the Condition that gave Right, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. <hi>Coming</hi> is a priviledge which the People that are invited to receive the Goſpel have, whom Chriſt by the Power and Efficacy of his Grace working with the Word compels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains, overcoming their Rebellious Hearts. As to that place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. you have as much Reaſon to inferr thence, that Confeſſion is a Condition, as well as Faith; the great Antecedent Condition there mentioned, is <hi>Hearing, by which Faith comes.</hi> As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. they all ſhew but connexion of Covenant-benefits, all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely given in the Promiſe of Eternal Life, Pardon and Faith, Faith and Holineſs, Grace and Glory, all ſounded upon one Condition of the Covenant, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                           <p>I muſt take notice of your ſhifting in your Antecedent, what do you put in <hi>as to the Diſpoſal of Benefits;</hi> the <hi>Diſpoſal of Benefits</hi> is the Performance of the Promiſe; your Condition ought to lie before the Diſpoſal of Benefits: If you mean an adjuſted Order in the diſpoſal of Benefits, you multiply Conditions to the end of the World, and turn all Benefits into Conditions. We are to talk of a Condition, upon which as ſuch, all others are Benefits, and relative Conditions are given forth by Promiſe: And we ſay, <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs</hi> is that Condition for which we are bleſſed with all Bleſſings in and through him; in and through him they are beſtowed, and all ways and means of beſtowing them are Bleſſings provided in him, and beſtowed by him; that there is a Method of Order in beſtowing them, and a relative Connexion between them there is, as alſo among the Bleſſings and Benefits, and is no hindrance to the Abſoluteneſs of the Promiſe. A Man gives me an Eſtate to come gradually to me 20 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> this year, and 20 <hi>l.</hi> next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is my having 20 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> this year the reaſon, by way of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of my having 20 <hi>l. per Annam</hi> more the next. The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all this Eſtate is reſolved into the Free-Will of the Donor, and his purchaſing of it for me with his Money.</p>
                           <p>As to your conſequence, it follows, you ſay, That all to whom the Offer is made have an Intereſt in them. I deny it utterly in ſuch Offers as God makes; for though the Tender of Grace be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, yet God knows who are his by Election and Redemption, and to them he gives his Son and his Spirit, and the firſt Gift of the Promiſe to perſwade and enable them to come unto Chriſt. Or you ſay, It's not a Serious Offer, <hi>viz.</hi> To offer Grace upon ſuch Terms and Conditions, which the Sinner is not able to perform. This Inference will rebound back again upon you, for ſaying, That theſe Conditions are freely wrought of God in us. Doth God work theſe Conditions before he offers them the Grace of the Covenant? If ſo, you ſay ſomething, and work them in all too to which they are offered; if not, it's not ſerious, as you and the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> will ſay. Therefore to ſupport your Hypotheſis, you muſt grant a Free-will in Man, and Power of himſelf to perform the ſaid Condition. <hi>Now it is true,</hi> you ſay, <hi>as not containing a real and natural Connexion between the Benefit and Duty.</hi> Why ſo? Can't Benefits be relative and truly connected, without there be a Foederal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? <hi>Having Food and Raiment, let us therewith be content.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is the Benefit here, and it's a Duty, and the Condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56391:111"/> wanting, the Bleſſing is not look'd for. Then you may ſay, Not having Food and Rayment ſufficient, I need not be content. Know this, the Spirit of God makes the Promiſe the Condition of the Duty. As to <hi>Abraham, I am God All-ſufficient, walk before me;</hi> and its always ſo, if we rightly underſtand the Language; for it firſt bids us <hi>live</hi> before it bids us <hi>do.</hi> And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of Works and that of Grace.</p>

And the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by Poſſeſſion of, and Communion with Chriſt, is greater by Faith than any other way, becauſe it's directed to Chriſt objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and receives more eminently Chriſt himſelf: And though it do ſo, yet it can't be the Condition of receiving Chriſt.

                           <p>Faith is for thoſe Uſes that Chriſt hath appointed, but he never appointed it for a Moral Foederal Condition: For if it be a Condition, it's ſo as an Act; and if as an Act, a Duty; and as a Duty, Moral, and ſo makes your Covenant only a Moral Law. Believing is more than a Sign; but it's moſt naturally ſo in your Sence; for in it's Conditionality you make it but the ſame with other Graces and Duties.

And the Apoſtle tells us, that this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was faulty; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, far differing,</hi>

Neither doth the Apoſtle mean only the meer Ceremonial part of that Miniſtry, but the morally legal and conditional way of Diſpenſation like the Covenant of Works: And therefore he ſaith, The new Covenant that he would make or promulge by the more excellent Miniſtry of the Mediator, it ſhould be publiſhed in the true, abſolute, and unconditional Light of it, not according to the <hi>Mount-Sinai</hi> Covenant upon their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

Beſides theſe explicit Covenants, there were Eccleſiaſtical Covenants, as they were a National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church; and in theſe Covenants they promiſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto God, and Obſervation of all his Appointments in that Diſpenſation, whereby God would have them to be viſibly a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſeparate People; and what they did in this kind in a right manner, was an Effect, and not a Cauſe of their true Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace; but the Covenant it ſelf as externally made, was a National Church-Covenant, as appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.15. and ſo when it was renewed in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, <hi>ch.</hi> 24. And I think any one that readeth that Solemn Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. will ſee, that it carried with it all the Thunder and Lightning of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to enforce it, and alſo the Bleſſings promiſed were Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Conditions were the Duties of the Moral Law and Ceremonies, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Now I wonder that any can pretend that this Covenant was the New Covenant, for ſo it was not in the Sence of the Apoſtle, and that it was a Miniſtry of the Covenant
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56391:112"/> of Grace any more than in a carnal and legal Diſpenſation after the manner of the Covenant of Works: And you ſhall find among the great things promiſed for the ſtrengthening and encouraging of the Faithful, one thing was the reforming the external Diſpenſation of Grace in taking off the Vails; and therefore always in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have it run as a free abſolute Promiſe, and God beginning firſt with them before any Condition is performed on their parts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Exek.</hi> 27.26. <hi>I will make a Covenant of Peace with them, and it ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 31.31, 33. Zech. 8.8.</p>
                           <p>Hence all external Covenant-Obligations that the Church makes are effects of this new Covenant-Intereſt; Covenants that they are obliged to, and Covenants that in the New Covenant are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed abſolutely as their Bleſſings and Priviledges, and in that way commended to Goſpel-Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> It's all Promiſe, and upon this account they are commanded to walk as a becoming People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch an Obligation of Free Grace laid upon them. Yea, God always in theſe Old Teſtament Covenants made his goodneſs and kindneſs to them firſt as a motive and condition unto them to build their Obedience upon, whereby he preached Free-Grace to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4. <hi>ch.</hi> 20.1. and innumerable other places. And you mention places your ſelf, which ſhew our Covenant with God is promiſed by him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5.—<hi>They ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God—They ſhall ask the way to Zion, ſaying, Come, let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> We grant every Believer doth actually and freely enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but it's becauſe God hath covenanted with him firſt: We are not reconciled to God but upon believing God's Reconciliation to us: Therefore the Goſpel-Miniſtry is the Declaration of God's Reconciliation, and from thence an Argument to perſwade us to be reconciled unto God.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56391:113"/> Old Covenant, and never intended it as a condition of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant with him, but a fruit and conſequent after they were in Covenant. It's mightily to derogate from the Covenant of Grace, to make the Promiſe thereof to depend on a ſtipulation on our part: For if we ſtipulate with God, we alſo promiſe to him, as well as he to us before Performance, and likewiſe that we do our part before he doth his; for the Stipitulation is covenanting; and for any Man to talk of any ſuch thing, runs upon mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Rocks: Our radical Stipitulation was in Chriſt, all other Stipitulations are effects of it.</p>

                           <p>And it's no leſs abſurd, that God reſtipulates to our covenanting, to make us firſt in covenanting with God, which is contrary to all

This we call Relative Conditions, or elſe things muſt ceaſe to have a Being.

                              </gap>, which is the Goſpel unvailed Miniſtration, which is ſaid, therefore to be New, becauſe of the full and clear Diſcovery that was made by the Revelation of Chriſt in his Coming and Miniſtry, which was not before: And in the ſame Sence <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> and <hi>Mount Zion</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. And what was ſeen by this laſt Miniſtration?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56391:116"/> It was, that Chriſt Jeſus was the Summ and Subſtance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miniſtration. 1. That it was a Covenant of Free-Grace, the Promiſe given upon the condition of Redemption by the Blood of Chriſt, which appeared to be the true intent of all the Sacrifices. 2. That though ſo much was conditionally required, yet no Duties could expiate ſin, or reconcile us to God: And the Reaſon of thoſe Duties are given us as truly, though then not ſo fully ſeen, was the performance of the Covenant-condition vertually in Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption typified by Redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 20. In a word, the Covenant of Grace ſtood vailed under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Pedagogy, which ſtood in a conditional Command under the Sanction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments moſtly Temporal, and under Types and Figures.</p>
                           <p>Now this miniſtration of the Letter ſtood under a double Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, which clouded the Glory and Beauty of the Promiſe. Firſt, A Typical and Shadowy Adminiſtration in Sacrifices, by which the great condition of the Covenant was pointed at, as being not yet come, and Symbolically only expreſs'd to their Faith. The other Fault was, the Moral <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> Vail, which called for Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as it were in the way of Foederal Condition, cauſed them to perform Duty as under a Spirit of Bondage, and in a mercenary manner, through the Encouragement of Temporal Rewards, and fear of Temporary Sufferings, and a ſeeming Attribution of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits to the Performances. And therefore the Apoſtle ſhews, that the Faultineſs lay here alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Not according to the Covenant I made with their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe they continued not in my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> they could not be ſaved by thoſe Legal conditional Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but by an abſolute Covenant couched under that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Miniſtration, being ſaved even as we; for the Law and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Miniſtration it was <hi>weak through the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. And you ſpeak very truly, that the true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> never loſt the Spiritual Advantage of the Covenant of Grace by reaſon of this vailed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, but look'd thorough the Vail by Faith; for the Law-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance at <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> did not, or could not diſannull it. <gap reason="foreign">

How abſurdly do you talk of making Believers firſt, and then taking them into Covenant? As if making Men Believers, and giving them new Hearts, were not taking them into Covenant. This is from your Principle, That there's no Promiſe of giving Pardon or Salvation to meer Sinners and Unbelievers, which is contrary to the whole Goſpel.

                           </p>
                           <p>The drift of this Chapter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. is to vindicate the juſt and righteous Proceedings of God: For they had charged God with Injuſtice and Unrighteouſneſs of his Dealings towards them, That the Son ſuffered for the Father's Sins, The <hi>Father eat ſowre Grapes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God Viſiting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> The Lord tells them, there's no Child ſuffers for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sins, any farther than he entails the Curſe, and as he walketh in his Fathers Sins: and that by perſonal Repentance of the vileſt Perſon a Man ſhould be ſaved, and not ſuffer for his Parents Sins.

                              </gap>, <hi>The way of God is not juſt or right. O houſe of Iſrael, (ſaith the Lord) are not my ways juſt? Are not yours unjuſt? For thus ſaith the Lord, I will judge you;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you ſtand ſo upon your own Juſtification, and cenſure my Juſtice; ſee now that you <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>turn you from your Iniquities, and ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi> And if they plead this, We cannot do it without the Gift of Grace, and thou change our Hearts. No, faith God, ſeeing you ſtand upon ſuch Terms with me, you muſt do as you have pretended you could. <hi>Ver.</hi> 31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſions—and make you a new Heart:</hi> Get up your ſelves ſuch Faith as thoſe have, who receive my Grace freely, and I give new Hearts to, and it ſhall be well with you: For, ſaith the Lord, my Nature is not to delight in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the Creature, (as no juſt Judge that paſſeth Sentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to afflict or kill the Priſoner at the Barr) I had according to my nature, rather he ſhould <hi>repent and live;</hi> but if he doth not, Juſtice requireth that he ſhould die. Now that which ſeems here to be chiefly aimed at, is, to convince them of their ſinful undone ſtate, that they were never able to perform ſo much as the external Commands of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any Commands to Repentance or Obedience in their own ſtrength and power. And ſeeing you charge me with this, That I accept not your pretended Repentance, but have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you away into Captivity, it's for the <hi>Iniquity of our Fathers,</hi> they have ſinned and we muſt ſuffer. No, ſaith God, do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Sin ſhall not be your ruine; make you new Hearts your ſelves. Seeing you pretend you deſerve ſo much, and have done ſo and ſo, let me now ſee what you can do without me as to Help
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56391:118"/> and Grace; you ſhall ſee I ſhall deal with you according to your Good, as well as according to your Wickedneſs. The Current of the Old Tkſtament is to convince them of the Faultineſs of this Conditional Covenant, and to confirm what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.31, 32. which is the Sence of that place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.23, 4. <hi>This thing I commanded them, but they hearkened not,</hi> &amp;c. That they continued not in that conditional way of Salvation, nor obtained the Law of Righteouſneſs, neglecting the true Spiritual meaning of the Sacrifices; but they that were ſaved, were ſaved as we, by Faith in a free and an unconditional Covenant of Grace.</p>

<q>He tells us what ſome ſay we owe to the Death of Chriſt, the <hi>Procuratum</hi> of the New Covenant, and that he ſuffered what God appointed he ſhould; not that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56391:119"/> the Juſtice of God required any ſuch thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in their ſtead, but what by a free Conſtitution of Divine Wiſdom and Soveraignty was appointed; and hereon God remitted the Terms of the Old Covenant, and entred into a New Covenant, ſuited unto Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are Faith and ſincere Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Others ſay, The whole Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us ſo far, as that we are made Partakers of the Benefits thereof. And that the way of the Communication of them unto us is by the New Covenant, which by his Death the Lord Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. For the Conditions of the Covenant are eſtabliſted in the Covenant it ſelf, whereon God will beſtow all the Benefits and Effects of it upon us, which are Faith and Obedience. Wherefore, what the Lord Chriſt hath done for us, is thus far accepted as our Legal Righteouſdeſs, as that God upon our Faith and Obedience with reſpect thereunto, doth releaſe and pardon all our Sins. Upon this Pardon there is no need of any poſitive perfect Righteouſneſs unto our Juſtification or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but our own perſonal Righteouſneſs is accepted with God in the room of it, by vertue of the New Covenant which Chriſt hath procured: So is the Doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtated by <hi>Curſellaeus,</hi> and thoſe that joyn with and follow him, as I take it you do.

                                 <p>The Application both of Grace and Glory, and all the good of the Covenant of Grace, are free to us, though conditioned unto Chriſt. Free Grace excludes not Chriſt's Merit, but Man's Merit.</p>
                                 <p>Obj. <hi>Faith is a Condition, though not of it ſelf, yet of Salvation, and that in the Elect themſelves: Therefore the Application of Salvation ſeems not to be free in reſpect of the Elect.</hi>

                                    <hi>A.</hi> A Condition is either a Condition properly ſo called, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Antecedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or a Condition improperly ſo called, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Conſequent Condition. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition properly ſo called is a Law or Obſervation, annexed to a buſineſs, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof lyeth upon the Covenant, and accordingly the buſineſs becomes valid or null. Such a Condition was Works in the firſt Covenant. If Faith were ſuch a Condition, there would ſoon be an end of the Covenant of Grace; yea, the Covenant of Grace were indeed no Covenant of Grace. A Condition improperly ſo called, or a conſequent Condition, is ſuch a Condition, whoſe performance by the Covenantee is abſolutely undertaken for, and irreſiſtibly wrought by the Covenanter, and not left in Suſpence upon the Covenantee, to be performed by his own ſtrength. Faith is a conſequent Condition, not an antecedent Condition. So as this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I will give Eternal Life to the Elect, if they believe,</hi> is equivalent unto this, <hi>I will out of my abſolute Will give unto the Elect Eternal Life, becauſe I will out of my abſolute Will give unto the Elect to believe.

<q>What Influence the Sacrifice of Chriſts Death, and the Righteouſneſs of his Life have upon our acceptance with God? The Gentleman that I once diſputed with ſtated the Queſtion ſo, and reſolved it as follows. [<hi>Antiſozzo,</hi> p. 580.] All that I can find in Scripture about this is, That to this we owe the Covenant of Grace; That God being well-pleaſed with the Obedience of Chriſt's Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death, for his ſake entred into a new Covenant with Mankind, wherein he promiſes pardon of Sin and eternal Life to thoſe who believe and obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</q>

Tho you think to put us off with a Promiſe of Pardon and Life to thoſe that believe and obey; the true Covenant of Grace hath given us a Promiſe of that Faith whereby we may believe, and of that New Heart, whereby we are enabled to obey the Goſpel. And Firſt, We have the Promiſe of the right Faith in the true Covenant, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.8. And leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, Faith is a common Gift, as other things are, the Apoſtle hath his reply ready, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19.

                              <p n="2">2. As it deſcribes not the whole of the Covenant, ſo it deſcribes not the Nature of a new Covenant. 1. It deſcribes no New Covenant in oppoſition to the Old Covenant of Works: The Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> promiſed Life upon condition of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We are told by you, that Chriſt hath added to the Moral Law, [<hi>i. e.</hi> to the Moral Duties required by the New Law, Faith and Repentance] which is to lay more Load on thoſe that were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged before. So that as you make Covenants, <hi>Adam</hi>'s was much the better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the two; but you have wiſely ſhuffled in a Promiſe of the Pardon of Sin, which may ſeem to give this Covenant a Preheminence above that of <hi>Adam:</hi> But that will not mend the matter, both becauſe it's better to have no Sin in our Natures, than ſuch a Remedy; better to have no Wound than ſuch a Plaiſter; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Promiſe of Pardon (as you ſay) is ſuſpended upon the condition of Faith and Obedience, which without a Supernatural real Influx of immediate Divine Power, reduceth the Promiſe to an impoſſibility of Performance. 2ly. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deſcribed is no new Covenant in oppoſition to the Old Adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace; there were the ſame Promiſes then that we have now, the ſame Moral Precepts that we have now. Though the Word <hi>Goſpel</hi> come in for a Blind, yet the Apoſtle aſſures us the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                              <p n="3">3. Upon the matter it's no Covenant of Grace at all, <hi>p.</hi> 584. For, 1. A Promiſe of Pardon and Life upon condition of believing and obeying, is neither better nor worſe than a Threatning of Condemnation and Death, to them who believe not and obey not. It may with equal right be called a Threatning of Death, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Life: It's no more of Grace than a Covenant of Wrath: And therefore, 2ly. (If it be lawful to conſider Man as the Word of God deſcribes him, dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes) It's no Covenant at all to him. For what is the nice difference betwixt the Promiſe of Life to him that obeys, when it's certain before-hand he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey, and no Promiſe at all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56391:121"/> (till I ſee evidence to the contrary) I ſhall take for granted that the Covenant of Grace is owing to, and founded on, and given forth by that Free Grace of God from whence its juſtly denominated a Covenant of Grace, though the Intervention of a Mediator, ſuch a Mediator was abſolutely neceſſary to put us into Actual Poſſeſſion of thoſe Rich Mercies deſigned to us by God in that Covenant; which Mediator himſelf is owing to, and founded on that Covenant of Grace; and therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is not founded upon him, but indeed for that Covenant [which Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi>] is pleaſed to call a Covenant of Grace, it's no great matter where it is founded; and therefore let him diſpoſe of his own Creature as he pleaſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See p. 581, 586. &amp;c.</q>

                        <p>AT our laſt Meeting we finiſhed our Debate about the Covenant of Grace, and the Conditions of it. What have you further, Mr. <hi>Neonomian,</hi> to diſcourſe Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> about.</p>

                           <hi>Divers Points beſides that he is erroneous in. The next I would challenge him upon, is Saving Faith, and the Nature of it: For his Errour is this:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That Saving Faith is nothing but a Perſwaſion or abſolute concluding within our ſelves, That our Sins are pardoned, and that Chriſt is ours.</hi> D. W. p. 73.</p>

                        <p>But you do not deny Faith to be a Perſwaſion, do you? If you do deny that Perſwaſion is the <hi>Genus</hi> of Faith, every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Porter, or Youth in the Sreet, will contradict you; for they will tell you, that they do believe this or that to be true. Ask them what they mean by Believing, they will tell you, They are perſwaded of it. They take Faith and Perſwaſion to be equivalent Terms, and indeed reciprocal; for that which I am perſwaded of I do believe, and that which I believe I am perſwaded of. But go on, let us hear what Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſaith in this Point.</p>

                        <p>I doubt not, Sir, but to prove that this is a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Saving Faith.

<q>If God have laid our Iniquity upon Chriſt, then whoſoever thou
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56391:123"/> art to whom the Lord will be pleaſed to give the believing of this Truth, that the Lord hath laid thine Iniquity on Chriſt, that laying thine Iniquity upon him is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and full Diſcharge to thee, that there neither is nor can be any Iniquity for the preſent, nor for hereafter, that can be laid to thy Charge; and then follows what he hath rehearſed.</q>

I quote that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. to me a very full Proof.</p>
                        <p>And I do affirm, that the Degrees of our Faith doth ſtand in the Degrees of the ſight of Chriſt's Glory, and the Perſwaſion we have in our Hearts of our part in him. And I do not ſay, That
<q>he is no Believer that hath not this perfectly; far be it from me to ſay ſo; there are that are Believers, that are weak in the Faith; and there are Believers that are ſtrong in the Faith; the more the Light and Glory of the Goſpel ſhines in the true Intention of God to his People, the more ſhall they return to their reſt, the more ſhall they have Joy and Gladneſs.

                        <p>They do in the ſhorter Catechiſm give a briefer Account of it, which may be more properly called a Definition.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is a Saving Grace, whereby we receive and reſt upon him alone for Salvation, as he is offered to us in the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>And if you pleaſe to turn to <hi>Queſt.</hi> 31. you ſhall ſee what they mean by <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>reſting:</hi> There they ſay,—
<q>Effectual Calling is the work of God's Spirit, whereby convincing us of our Sin and Miſery, enlightning our Minds in the knowledge of Chriſt, and renewing our Wills, he doth perſwade and enable us to embrace Jeſus Chriſt freely offered to us in the Goſpel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the <hi>Larger Catechiſm</hi> you have a full Deſcription of Faith as Juſtifying, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 72. wherein there is the <hi>Genus</hi> of it, a ſaving Grace; the principal efficient Cauſe, the Spirit; the <hi>Cauſa mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant,</hi> the ſubſervient efficient Cauſe, the Word: Both <hi>Cauſae procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes.</hi> The Subject in whom it is wrought, a ſinful, miſerable and loſt Creature, really ſo, and in his own Eyes. And then you have the Material Cauſe, the truth of the Promiſe of the Goſpel. In the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> (wherein it's more largely expreſs'd) it's <hi>whatever is revealed in the Word,</hi> this is the Objective part of it, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. The Form of Saving Faith is an Impreſſion wrought upon the Soul from the proper Efficacy of the Spirit, by the Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the acceptable Nature and Evidence thereof. The Truth muſt have Goodneſs in it, becauſe we believe many things that we fear and are averſe to. The Word works objectively upon the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſwading it to aſſent and ſet to it's Seal, that the Word is Truth, and from the Goodneſs in that Truth it perſwades the Will to embrace, becauſe <hi>Voluntas ſequitur ultimum dictamen intellectus;</hi> and the conſenting of the Will is an Effect of the aſſenting of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; Hence then it's not barely believing without Ground, but upon ſome Authority. In the Confeſſion 'tis ſaid, For the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God himſelf ſpeaking in the Word, which is believing on Chriſt, believing in God, from whence follows an awful Reverence and Regard to his Word, as alſo the reſting and depending of the Soul thereon: And when it's determined to the Grace of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (it's as in the Larger and Shorter Catechiſm) it receiveth Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs in the Promiſe, and reſteth thereon for Pardon of Sin. Juſtifying Grace through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the Object, and that which it aims at, is the accepting and accounting of a Mans Perſon Righteous in the ſight of God for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is fuller expreſs'd in the Confeſſion, ſhewing what ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith in the largeſt Sence deſigns, <hi>viz.</hi> accepting, receiving and reſting upon Chriſt alone (excluding all other Foederal Conditions)
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56391:124"/> for Juſtification, Sanctification and Eternal Life, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace. Now you ſee how clearly they make Faith a Perſwaſion, and that it doth all objectively, by taking in the Truth and receiving it; for the Underſtanding receiveth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth by being perſwaded, it takes in the Light of Truth, and the Will embraceth by being perſwaded, and the great procatarctick Cauſe is the Covenant of Grace. Now I ſee you have a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Notion of making it a Condition and moral Inſtrument, <hi>i. e.</hi> A moral Condition of the Covenant, and ſo a Work, and as ſuch to reach the End of the Covenant, which I utterly deny; for that would deſtroy it's own Nature and Uſe, and alſo the Covenant of Grace it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>You acknowledge then that Faith contains in it, 1. A Reliance on Chriſt as an only Saviour. How can this be without ſome perſwaſion? A rational Man never reſts and leans upon a thing that he hath not ſome ground of Perſwaſion that it's ſtrong enough to bear him. 2. You own it includes a realizing Aſſent to the Truth, and this is a very high Perſwaſion of a Truth, with a particular Application of it to a Man's ſelf as belonging to him. 3. You ſay there's an unfeigned Fiducial Conſent to, and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Chriſt and all his Offices. This is ſtrong Confidence, when the Soul is ſo far perſwaded of the reality of the Tender of Chriſt made in the Promiſe, that he doth not only take him, but with boldneſs; queſtions not but he hath the Son, and hath Life in this very Act of Believing. You ſay we rely on Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Merits, as what alone purchaſed our Pardon and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.

You wrong me to ſay, I uſed the Words <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> I ſaid, If you receive Truth, and in reality believe it, and rely upon it, you may conclude that Chriſt is yours; and this is now a Concluſion made upon my believing too. I pray would you not ſay ſo to a poor Sinner, If thou doſt believe on the Lord Jeſus with all thy Heart, thou ſhalt be ſaved; and you ought to conclude you ſhall be ſaved?

                        <p>Your Argument runs two ways, or ſhould. 1. Againſt Perſwaſion, as not being the Genus of Faith; and it ſtands thus: If they that do not ſavingly believe may have Perſwaſion, then Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is not of the Eſſence of Faith; but they that do not ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe may have Perſwaſion, <hi>Ergo. Negatur conſequ. Homo eſt Animal, Ergo Brutum non eſt Animal.</hi> There's two Species of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, thoſe that have a Faith, not ſaving, as meerly Hiſtorical, Temporary, or Faith of Miracles, and thoſe that have Saving. Faith is the Genus of both thoſe Species, which is Perſwaſion. Now you argue, becauſe ſuch as have not a Saving Faith have Perſwaſion, therefore they that have Saving Faith, have not Perſwaſion. <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> but rather quite contrary, that they have; for the Genus communicates it's common Nature to both Species.</p>

                        <p>I thought ſo, I was going to ſpeak that. No indeed, it's not a diſtinction of Faith, but a particular Inſtance of one thing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56391:126"/> believed by us. If you ſhould ask me, what Faith is? and I ſhould tell you, it's believing <hi>Peter</hi> betray'd Chriſt, or that <hi>Paul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, you would take me to be very ridiculous: Or I ſhould ſay, it is not believing that I am a rich Man: So that if you will have the Queſtion run in a particular Inſtance: it's eaſily decided; for all true Rules of Art muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

We have our firſt Earneſt for Bleſſedneſs in the Perſwaſion of Faith, in the very Act of it; and it's Non ſence to talk any way of partaking of Chriſt, but by the Spirit and Faith: And he that in an Act of believing at firſt finds Chriſt in the true Perſwaſion of Faith, doth not, nor cannot ſay of Chriſt he is his before he is ſo. The Soul cannot be too nimble for Chriſt; and if he that believeth not, makes God a Liar, what are thoſe that perſwade to Unbelief? That Faith in it's very Act is an Evidence, is no hinderance to the Trial and Examination of our ſelves by the Fruit of Faith beſides. And though the Propoſition in the Goſpel be an indefinite Propoſition, yet the Application by Faith in a Sinner, ought to be particular and fiducial, or elſe the Faith of Believers will be no more than that of others that believe only that Chriſt came to ſave Sinners; and if the Promiſe of Pardon were not to Sinners as ſuch, it were not Pardon;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56391:127"/> and if a Man upon Trial muſt firſt find by Signs that he doth believe, before he lay claim to Pardon, Sinners would be in a ſad condition: But this is the comfort, that as the Promiſe of Pardon is the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believing, ſo believing it ſelf is the receiving and perceiving of it: And the Soul ſaith, or ſhould by Faith, <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> At the ſight of Chriſt it ſaith, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> If the Lord ſpeak to a Believer, in believing, by his Word and Spirit, <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven,</hi> it's not ſaid ſo to one that is a Believer firſt: <hi>Relata</hi> are <hi>ſimul naturâ:</hi> The Promiſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is not a Promiſe or Gift to one that's a Father firſt, nor Sonſhip to one that is a Son firſt.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56391:128"/> is that which ſets us above the Charge of Sin and Condemnation. By the Reſurrection of Chriſt Preached, we are begotten to this lively believing hope, and we are riſen with him through this Faith of the Operation of God; hence the Body of Sin is deſtroyed, Death aboliſhed, Life and Immortality brought to light; Chriſt by his Reſurrection being diſcharged and juſtified from the Iniquities of us all, which were laid upon him, and which he bore in his Body upon the Tree.</p>

                           <p>This Work of Faith, as it doth greatly glorifie God, in aſcribing the whole Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Salvation only to Free Grace in Chriſt, ſo God doth highly honour it above all Fellow-Graces, by making it the bleſſed Inſtrument of all the Comfort we enjoy in this World, thereby giving us aſſurance of our Juſtification in his ſight by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and a double Comfort. 1. Peace of Conſcience, reſting it ſelf ſecure upon the Stability of God's Promiſe, againſt the Severities of Juſtice, the Accuſations of the Law; it hath, wherewithall to anſwer even an All-ſufficient, Righteouſneſs in Chriſt —</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That kind of <hi>Fiducia</hi> which we call Aſſurance of full pardon of our Sins: This is the fruit of that <hi>Fiducia,</hi> or truſting unto the Promiſe it ſelf, wherein ſtands the proper Act of Juſtifying Faith. — Many do ſtedfaſtly believe, and reſt themſelves only upon Chriſt for Salvation, who yet would give a World to be aſſured and fully perſwaded that their ſins are pardoned — Whereupon they will be apt to fall back and ſay, They do not, nor can't believe at all. A great miſtake, and that which caſteth many a Conſcience upon the Rack. It's a falſe Argument; for Juſtifying Faith is not to be aſſured of Pardon, but to truſt wholly upon the Promiſe for Pardon.</p>
                           <p>What is Eſſential unto Faith is manifeſt: That which in order of Nature ſeems to have the Precedency,<note place="margin">Dr. O. of Juſtific. <hi>p. 135.</hi>

The Aſſent of the Mind hereunto as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Promiſe of the Goſpel, is the Root of Faith, the Foundation of all that the Soul doth in believing; nor is there any Evangelical Faith without it, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it Abſtractedly, as a meer Act of the Mind, the Eſſence of Juſtifying Faith doth not conſiſt ſolely therein.</p>

                           <hi>The Truth is this, Chriſt is freely offered to be Head and Saviour to the vileſt Sinners, who will knowingly Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, and from a Conviction of their Sin and Miſery out of Chriſt, are humbled, and truely renounce all their Idols and Sins; denying their Carnal Self, and Merits, and accept of Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel, relying on him alone for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal Life.</hi> D.

                        <p>And you ſhould add, When they ſee they can do all theſe things, then they ſhould come to Chriſt, and not before; you reckon that a Sinner is only invited to Chriſt for Remiſſion of Sins, but not for Repentance, and the ſenſible Concomitants thereof, whereas his Office is to give Repentance too. And how do you mean? That Chriſt is offered to be Head and Saviour, do you mean Myſtical Head? Chriſt makes himſelf ſo to every Sinner, he works Faith in them. If you mean King, as I ſuppoſe you do,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56391:132"/> that the firſt Notion Chriſt offers himſelf to Sinners under, is as King, and that's the firſt Notio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

An Earthly King will not offer himſelf as Kings to a Rebel, but under the Notion of Pardon and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>Again, Is not a knowing Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel a higher degree of Perſwaſion and Aſſurance than I ſpeak of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt? If you intend Truth of the Goſpel as I do, and then it's offering Chriſt as a Saviour to the vileſt of Sinners that will come to him, and ſaying to the vileſt of Sinners, That they ſhould come to Chriſt, and he will in no wiſe caſt them off; but if you look for Sinners truely humbled, and truely renouncing their Sins and Righteouſneſs, and in a readineſs to accept Chriſt before you offer him, I know not when you will offer him, and they muſt ceaſe to be vile Sinners, and become Holy out of Chriſt before he be offered.</p>

                        <p>What is it that you would prove? That which you are to prove is this, That the habitual diſpoſition of the Soul is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to the dominion of Sin, and as to the filthineſs thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt; and now you ſhift the Terms, and after you have been ſpeaking all this while of Preparatory Works, how we muſt be humbled, have ſelf-denial, and caſt off all our Idols, before we have an Intereſt in Chriſt; now you ſhuffle your Cards, and ſay, The Soul is not continued under the Reigning Power of Enmity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till after his Intereſt in Chriſt.

That all this while you make ſuch a noiſe and vapour of what we have before we come to Chriſt; It's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but what we have by Vertue of an Intereſt in Chriſt. And your Argument ſhould run thus: If Effectual Calling makes this change in the habitual diſpoſition of the Heart, and is neceſſary antecedaneouſly to our Intereſt in Chriſt, then this Enmity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Filthineſs is taken away before our Intereſt in Chriſt; <hi>Ergo:</hi> We deny the conſequence, for this reaſon, Becauſe the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of Sin hath it's firſt blow in our Effectual Calling, and then, and not before, we are beginning to be made holy, and this Effectual Calling is our Intereſt in Chriſt; Sin ſhall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56391:136"/> over us, becauſe we are under Grace; Chriſt is made to us Sanctification, and we are Sanctified in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now you ſhift your Hands and fay, We do not lye under this Enmity till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saving Intereſt; and good Reaſon, becauſe Chriſt hath ſlain the Enmity upon the Croſs, and the Doctrine of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being received by Faith in our Effectual Calling, the Enmity is ſlain there alſo; the New Man put on, we are Created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works, and the depraved diſpoſition and habit changed, and now what you go about to conclude; is ſo far from the Queſtion, that it is againſt you: but you ſay, <hi>P.</hi> 85. That this diſpoſition is altered in Effectual Vocation, and there can be no true coming to Chriſt for Pardon, and eſpecially for Sanctification, without that purpoſe; whence it appears, that Effectual Vocation muſt be before Saving Faith in Chriſt, and that therein the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of Sin muſt be ſlain before Juſtifying Faith, or any San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace, that is the Fruit of it.</p>

                        <p>All his humblings, prickings, wearineſs, awakenings, were by the Power of Goſpel Grace, and by the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt's Miniſtry is enough with his Power to ſave Souls; he needs no prerequiſites. The Goſpel is the power of God unto Salvation, therewith he wounds, and therewith he makes whole; Chriſt makes weary, and gives reſt; he convinceth Sinners, and gives Repentance; the preaching Chriſt Crucified pricked thoſe Converts to the Heart, and healed thoſe Wounds. It was the ſame Hand of Grace that awakened the Gaoler, and when he had a Knife in his Hand even to Murder Chriſt in his Members; and when he ſaw that was wrinched out of his Hand, took a Knife to Murder himſelf; in the height of that deſperate Villany, he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he ſhould be ſaved. The caſe plainly is this, That Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Miniſter of the true Sanctuary, and the preaching of him, is the only and ſufficient Remedy to change and ſave the worſt of Sinners through the effectual working of the Spirit; the order and method is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it's as the Spirit liſteth, we are not to preſcribe any methods or meaſures of Humblings, much leſs to ſay ſuch and ſuch Moral Vertues or Duties are neceſſary Prerequiſites and Qualifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sinner comes to Chriſt.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56391:138"/> by ſetting Chriſt before the moſt refractory Sinners' for all Salvation; true Mourning and Humiliation proceeds from looking on him whom a poor Sinner hath pierced: I am for the bringing of the moſt Leprous Sinner, (I cannot engage he will come,) to waſh in this Spirtiual <hi>Jordan,</hi> though I find you are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for waſhing off his Leproſie firſt in the Rivers of <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharfar</hi> Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>

                        <p>You miſtake the whole ſence of the Goſpel, or will not underſtand it, that you may ſeem to have a plauſible pretence to oppoſe it: When Sinners are invited to come to Chriſt, it's not meerly under the Notion of Pardon, but of all Salvation; he is offered, and the Sinner is invited to come unto him, as having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>himſelf for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity, and to purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar People Zealous of good Works.</hi> A Sinner is by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel called to Chriſt in all ſtates of his Unregeneracy, whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly Prophane, or Morally Vertuous; one is as eaſily ſaved by Chriſt as the other; the former ordinarily ſooner, eaſier conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeemingly than the latter; neither is the latter better qualified and fitted for the Grace of God than the other. That place quoted by you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. is a clear proof how the Word of God's Grace works theſe true Convictions in the Saving Work, and that your Humblings in the ſtate of Unregeneracy are no neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſites to the Grace of God.</p>

                        <p>But they tell us that that Conviction which is Saving comes by Saving Faith, their words are, Juſtifying Faith is a Saving Grace wrought in the Heart of a Sinner by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby he being convinced of his Sin and Miſery, and of diſability in himſelf and other Creatures to recover him out of his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56391:139"/> loſt Condition, not only aſſenteth to the Truth of the Promiſe of the Goſpel, but receiveth and reſteth upon Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Shorter Catechiſm you may ſee a more particular account of Saving Convictions, that they are wrought in Effectual Calling, though they be not ſo properly of the Nature of Juſtifying Faith; for they ſay, Effectual Calling is the Work of God's Spirit, whereby convincing us of our Sin and Miſery, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning our Minds, <hi>&amp;c. He doth perſwade and enable us to embrace Jeſus Chriſt freely offered to us in the Goſpel.</hi> You ſee Conviction and Illumination are both the Saving Works of the Spirit. And in the Confeſſion they'll tell you, That Saving Faith is of a larger extent as to the Object it Acts upon, than meerly Juſtifying, Saving Faith; it convinceth, it enlightens, it juſtifies, it ſanctifies, and in this ſence they tell you the Nature of Saving Faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. whereby they are enabled to believe to the ſaving of their Souls — and by this Faith a Chriſtian is enabled to believe to be true what-ever is revealed in the Word, and —from thence comes trembling at the Word, and embracing the Promiſes of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this contradicts not, but confirms the Doctrine of the 39 Articles, That all Works before Faith, even Legal Convictions, are no more than Sin; it's but the filthy Conſcience-polluting Guilt of Sin, which Thouſands have, and which do not diſpoſe the Sinner to love God, but to hate him; nor to ſeek Pardon, but to ſeek out a Righteouſneſs of his own.</p>

                        <p>If he mean ſaving believing, he muſt mean previous <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> not as a Preparatory Vertue, but as Sin is previous to Pardon, and thereby Guilt alſo, whereby Sin pollutes the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and is both ſin and miſery; and this may ariſe from a meer natural ſtirring of the Law, or by the preaching of it, which is the Death of Sin, the Wrath and Curſe that attends it; and this may and muſt ariſe from a common Faith; for a Man is not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of any thing that he believes not. But if he mean Saving Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are good Fruits, and wrought in Saving Faith. This he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends here: For he ſaid juſt before, Let no Man think to underſtand the Goſpel, who knows nothing of the Law; God's Conſtitution, and the Nature of things themſelves, have given the Law the precedency with reſpect unto Sinners; for by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin, and Goſpel Faith is the Souls acting according to the Mind of God, for deliverance from that State and Condition which it is caſt under
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56391:140"/> by the Law; and he ſuppoſeth the State of a Man under meer Legal Conviction to be a State of Death and Condemnation.</p>

                        <p>True Convictions, <hi>i. e.</hi> Saving, have ſuch Effects; but obſerve, he is there diſtinguiſhing between common Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which before Faith are the common Condition of Sinners more or leſs, which is the Death they lye under. He ſaith, <q>Temporary Faith and Legal Conviction are the Principles of all Works or Duties in Religion An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent unto Juſtification, [obſerve now what he ſaith] which therefore we muſt deny to have in them any Cauſality thereof; and ſo he proceeds to ſhew what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Duties in Religion may follow thence; not that they are Goſpel Vertues, but rather <hi>ſolendida peccata;</hi> and they, I ſay, are ſo far from diſpoſing the Natural Man to Juſtification by Grace, that they diſpoſe him rather to ſeek Juſtification in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Works of the Law, till the Law comes to be Preached in true Spirituality in the Goſpel, and received by Faith. — And he ſaith, <hi>P.</hi> 103. That Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Life — and theſe things are where real Convictions are; but yet it muſt be ſaid, that they are neither ſeverally nor jointly, though in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, either neceſſary Diſpoſitions, Preparations previous, Congruities in a way of Merit, or Conditions of our Juſtification.</q>

But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> It's contrary to the Scriptures to ſay they are Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, by way of Cauſation, Merit and Congruity, [<hi>i. e.</hi> by diſpoſing, fitting, and making Men the ſitter for Effectual Grace, as you ſay] as aſſerted by the Papiſts and Arminians.</p>

The Apoſtle ſpeaks of full Aſſurance of Faith, and of coming to the Throne of Grace with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs — I ſhew'd that it may be found out as the Lord hath chalked it out— in his Grace and Grant; not only when the Lord is pleaſed to hold out his Grace and Grant to a Man, but alſo upon thoſe Terms that he holds it out on, ſuch as the Terms of God are, or Conditions, if you will call them ſo. Sure I am; as the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, by which they may claim Intereſt in Chriſt; thoſe conditions being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and found, the Soul may cloſe with the Grace of God; now all the difficulty lyes in this, whether the Lord propounds to Men, that there ſhall be no part in Chriſt, nor Grace by him till they find their Spirits, Souls and Bodies ſanctified throughout, or whether the Lord holds out the Grant of Pardon of Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe previous Qualifications. And I ſay,<note place="margin">D. <hi>C.</hi> p. 433.</note> That the Grace of ſaying Iniquity upon Chriſt is applicable by Forgiveneſs of Sins to Perſons before there be ever the leaſt meaſure of Sanctification in Works; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed by the Lords own Grant, there may be Safety and Security in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame by Faith, without regard to Sanctification in any meaſure.</q>
                        <p>That is, in reſpect of making Trial thereby, I ſeeing yet no Sanctification in Works to try by; it's certain ſuch Pardon is to be had, and that the Grace of Forgiveneſs is applicable before Works, or a Perſon capable of doing them, as to Elect Infants, and to the Dying Thief, and hath the ſame place in every Elect Perſon that doth believe, forgiveneſs is applied to him before he can exert any of the working Fruits of Faith, and being applied to him by God's Grant, it may be applied to himſelf by Believing; but becauſe you inſiſt on nothing in this Sermon that you particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs, I ſay no more of it now.</p>

                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <p>I ſhew'd that Chriſt himſelf frames and creates that very Faith in Perſons that come to him,<note place="margin">D. <hi>C.</hi> p. 614.</note> uniting them as Members firſt to him their Head. 2. I ſhew'd that a Branch muſt have Union with the Root before it can bring forth Fruit. Chriſt is the Vine, we the Branches, Faith part of the Fruit. Communion is a Fruit of Union, Faith is a Grace of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Suppoſe that the Life ſpoken of is not in Perſons till they believe it is,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 615.</note> but this, That there is no Activeneſs of the life of Chriſt in the Perſon that is Elected, his Life is in Chriſt, and was in Chriſt, and reſerved in Chriſt till the time of believing, for him; and then doth the Elect Perſon become Active in Life, when Chriſt doth give him to believe Actually.</p>
                           <p>But to ſay that this believing ſhould give the firſt Being of that Life that ſhould be in Perſons, is to ſay, There is not that Life of the Elect Perſons in Chriſt before they do believe; if this be maintained, that there is no Juſtification at all belonging to Elect Perſons, till they do Actually believe in Chriſt, or Faith be the Inſtrument by which they are firſt united, dangerous Conſequences muſt needs follow. 1. That in ſome reſpect there will be a bringing to Life again the Covenant of Works, <hi>Do this and live, viz.</hi> for Perſons to <hi>do</hi> that they may live; but the Covenant of Grace, gives Life firſt, and from Life comes Doing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the words you refer to <hi>p.</hi> 616.

                        <p>You know his meaning by thoſe Similes, and they are not to run on four Feet; it's enough they ſerve to illuſtrate that part of Truth which they are uſed for. Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> means as you do as to Man's Will. There's nothing more contrary to a rebellious carnal Man, than the Graee of God; their Hearts are full of Enmity and Hatred to God and Truth; but yet he ſhews you often that God gives Gifts to the Rebellious. And here you ſee how he gives it, and what he gives; it may be he binds them with the <hi>cords of afflictions,</hi> and opens their Eyes to ſee their undone condition, pours into their Conſciences whole Potions of the Guilt of Sin, and the Laws Condemnation, whereby as undone Creatures, through Grace they become willing and ready to receive Chriſt, and he becomes precious to them by the ſame hand of his Spirit. If you ſhould pick up odd Similes out of Sermons, which it may be hath done good, and God hath bleſſed, you may expoſe many a good Man's Labours.

                        <p n="2">2. I underſtand you mean that in Effectual Calling a Man is not united to Chriſt till he doth Actually accept of Chriſt the Head by an Act of Faith, whereas the Head unites the Members to it ſelf before they can reach up to the Head.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the whole uſe of Faith in Juſtification, is only to manifeſt that we were Juſtified before; and Faith is no way neceſſary to bring a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into a Juſtified State, nor at all uſeful to that end.</hi> D. W. p. 103.</p>

                           <hi>You put this Objection, Is not believing required unto the Juſtification of the ungodly?</hi> Anſw. <hi>An ungodly Perſon after he is Juſtified doth believe; but you will ſay it is an Act of Chriſt by Faith.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Then Chriſt doth not Juſtifie alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay, I ſay more, Chriſt doth Juſtifie a Perſon before he doth believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which is not, —but he is firſt Juſtified before he believes, then he believes he is Juſtified.</hi> Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 85.</p>

                        <speaker>Antinom.</speaker>
                        <q>My words were theſe, An ungodly Perſon after he is Juſtified doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: But you muſt underſtand it, it is not the Faith of the Perſon that doth ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and properly Juſtifie; but it is that Chriſt in whom he doth believe, he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him that Juſtifieth the ungodly. It is he that Juſtifieth, that is Chriſt. It is not believing that juſtifieth; mark well that Phraſe, <hi>he that juſtifieth,</hi> Juſtification is an Act of Chriſt, not an Act of Faith.</q>
                        <p>How often is it ſaid, it's <hi>God that Juſtifieth?</hi> Juſtification is an Act of God, and not of ours, Faith is an Act of ours; it's God by his Grace efficiently Juſtifies, and imputeth the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; we are materially and objectively Juſtified by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and by that alone; and this I ſay is before a Sinner believes efficiently, becauſe the Object muſt be before the Act of the Recipient Organ. A Man ſees becauſe there is Light to ſee, which illuminates the Organ; eſpecially ſuch a Light as takes off a privation of ſight, and reſtores the Habit, ſo that Juſtification in regard of Application muſt be before believing; the firſt Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in <hi>ordine naturae ſaltem,</hi> is to an ungodly Man, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> that he may believe, who is thereby made to believe that he may be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed, for in Juſtification we are both Paſſive and Active; as <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius</hi> ſaith.</p>

                                 <hi>Norton,</hi> p. 214.</note> hath this Objection. If we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith, then Faith is in order before Juſtification, and conſequently the Act is before the Object, whereas on the contrary the Act depends on the Object, and not the Object on the Act; to this Effect <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We diſtinguiſh between the Being of Juſtification, and our being Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> between Juſtification as taken in an Abſtract Sence, <hi>viz.</hi> without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Subject thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> a Believer, and a Juſtification taken in a Concrete Sence, <hi>i. e.</hi> together with the Believer.</p>
                           <p>Juſtification conſidered in the Actſtract Sence, taken ſimply and in it ſelf, which ſignifieth Remiſſion of Sins, and Righteouſneſs to Acceptation prepared for, though not yet conferred upon the Elect, hath before Faith a Being not only in the purpoſe of God, but alſo in the Covenant between the Father and Mediator, and in the purchaſe of Chriſt. This Truth held forth in the Goſpel makes the Object of Faith, and thus the Object is before the Act. The Grounds of this diſtinction or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Juſtification actually procured, and actually applyed. — Juſtification was in God's Decree before Faith,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>P.</hi> 315, 316.</note> before Sin, yea, from all Eternity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.25.</p>
                           <p>The Actual procuring of Juſtification as conſidered in it ſelf, gives a Being to Juſtifying Faith: Juſtification is compared to a Garment, our being Juſtified to a Garment put on.</p>
                           <p>Juſtification of the Elect is abſolutely and actually procured for them by Chriſt's Satisfaction before Faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. The Hand writing of Ordinances cannot be limited to the Ceremonial Law only, becauſe it had reſpect unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to whom the Ceremonial Law belonged not, God hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Acceptation of Chriſt,<note place="margin">So <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place. <hi>P. 216.</hi>
                              </note> whereby he hath actually procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Juſtification for the Elect before Faith. It is no ſmall part of the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, That God Imputed unto Chriſt the Sins of the World of the Elect before they did believe, and will not impute them unto the Elect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
                           <p>This great Goſpel Truth is of ſpecial uſe to beget Juſtifying Faith in the Heart of a Sinner. The ſame the Apoſtle confirms concerning their Reconciliation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. That it was wrought for them when they were Enemies, <hi>i. e.</hi> Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                           <p>Here is a Twofold Reconciliation mentioned, one at the Death of Chriſt before <hi>Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome of them at leaſt, were Believers, the other at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Reconciliation, though it was vertually wrought before by the <hi>Lamb ſlain</hi> (in God's Appointment and Acceptance, togethr with his own conſent) <hi>from the beginning of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. yet it was not Actually wrought until the Death of Chriſt; for this Satisfaction ſake God Imputes not Sin unto the Redeemed, (for he cannot Impute Sin to Chriſt and the Elect both) yea, <hi>he accepteth us in the Beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. Loving the <hi>Perſons of the Elect,</hi> Rom 11.28. though hating their Sins, and alſo their State <hi>under the Curſe of the Law,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. The ſecond is wrought at our Converſion, when the Enmity of Nature is ſlain by the Infuſion of Grace.</p>

When Perſons are Believers, they ceaſe to be ungodly; but if Men be not juſtified till they do believe, Chriſt doth not juſtify the ungodly, but rather we muſt believe on him that juſtifies the righteous. But as I ſaid, we do not believe that we may be juſtifyed; but we do believe, and truly believe when we are, and becauſe we are Juſtified. So that ſtill it ſtands firm, we are not juſtified, we are not in Covenant, we partake not in the Covenant by any Condition we perform, till which Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance the Covenant cannot be made good unto us; but we are in Covenant, and Chriſt makes us to be in Covenant for his own ſake, without any Condition in the Creature.

                              <hi>Dr.</hi> C. <hi>p.</hi> 578.</note> for my own part, I cannot conceive any other conſiderable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the plea of Chriſt for a Converted Perſon, and the unconverted Elect, but this Circumſtantial difference, namely, that the value of his Blood is of equal force to Believers and Unbelievers being Elected, ſaving that the Believers have this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Lord Chriſt pleads for the Manifeſtation of this diſcharge unto this Converted Perſon, but pleads not for the preſent Manifeſtation thereof unto the Unconverted Elect Perſon, till ſuch time as he ſhall be called to the Faith, and by that Faith that thing be made evident which before was hid.

                        <p>Shew me how any Perſon ununited to Chriſt can believe, and how any one that is unjuſtified can be actually united to Chriſt, as he muſt needs be before he can believe.</p>

It's very abſurd to ſay, Sin barrs God's Act of Pardon. It's true, Unbelief influenceth a Sinner as to his own Acts, and will be charged upon him as his Fault, and will
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56391:147"/> aggravate that Condemnation which he hath under the Law, becauſe from his own corrupt Will and Affection he will not receive Pardon and Life that is offered in the General and Indefinite Tender there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made in the Goſpel: And therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that you may have Life.</hi> Heb. 3.18, 19. <hi>They could not enter by reaſon of unbelief.</hi> Unbelief on our part doth keep us from Chriſt, but hinders not on God's part, that effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally draws all the Elect, juſtifying of them, and working <hi>Faith</hi> in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.

                                 <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſerves for the manifeſtation of that Juſtification which Chriſt puts upon a Perſon by himſelf alone, that you by believing on him may have the Declaration and Manifeſtation of your Juſtification.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>And I ſay, That it is not the Condition without which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit from Chriſt, but rather a manifeſtation thereof. My Words are not, That the uſe of Faith is only a manifeſtation, but I ſay, Rather a manifeſtation of Benefits received, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of receiving benefits. And I ſay, it is a Declaration and Manifeſtation. And what is the Promiſe in the hand of Faith, but a Declaration of the Grace of God in Juſtification of a Sinner, and thereby a manifeſtation of it unto the Conſcience? Whereby Juſtification comes to be in <hi>foro Conſcientiae:</hi> For I ſay, Where the Condemnation of a Sinner is by the Law, there the Abſolution of the Sinner is by the Goſpel, but Condemnation of a Sinner is in Conſcience by the Law; therefore there his Abſolution is by the Goſpel, and that's by a Goſpel-Sentence pronounced and believed, which Sentence is God's Declaration, and Faith ſealing to the Truth of it, applies it, and is the Eccho of the ſaid Declaration in the Soul. And you ſay Faith juſtifies as receiving Chriſt, and you ſay well, Chriſt is received in the believing of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56391:148"/> Goſpel-Declaration. The Declaration in the Goſpel is, Life by Chriſt. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.25. <hi>This is the Promiſe that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us, evrn eternal Life.</hi> 1 John 5.11. <hi>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son; and this is the witneſs of God which he hath testifi'd of his Son.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf:</hi> It ſhould be <hi>Teſtimony,</hi>

                           </gap>: This very believing is a Teſtimony of the Truth of the Promiſe, and his part in it, as by the latter part of the 10th Verſe appears, <hi>He that believeth not makes God a Liar;</hi> and as the truth of the Promiſe concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life; this believing he ſaith is having the Son as declared in the Promiſe and Record, that takes in the Declaration believingly.</hi> And this is apprehending, and applying, and relying on the Promiſe, and Chriſt in it, both as Truth and Goodneſs. Believing is our <hi>modus recipiendi,</hi> or manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and we do believe that we may receive and apprehend him unto Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>You add, and ſay firſt, Faith juſtifies by receiving of Chriſt; but you ſay, it's Application of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Effects you mean only: You do not deal above-board, you are not for the application of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs it ſelf impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and put on by us in believing: We have noted your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in this kind already; you'll not have Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to us for our Righteouſneſs, according to all the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scripture, but only the Effects given us, as effectual Calling, Sanctification and Glorification: So that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt juſtifies no otherwiſe than it ſanctifies and glorifies; for it doth theſe as Effects. But I pray expreſs your ſelf more clearly how Faith Juſtifies, or what part Faith hath in Juſtification ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Senſe, without ſo much ambiguity.</p>

                        <p>That Faith juſtifies not as a Qualifying Condition is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Faith as a Quality is a Work of the Law. The Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Faith a leading Duty in it: But no Man is <hi>justified by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.28. So <hi>Wolleb.

Q. 63.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That which cannot ſtand with Grace in Juſtification, cannot have any Influence on Juſtification as ſuch; but for Faith to have any cauſal Influence as a Work on Juſtification, is inconſiſtent with Grace. The <hi>Minor</hi> is prov'd, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. That which gives no more to Faith in the buſineſs of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, than to other Works of Sanctification, cannot be true; but to make Faith to Juſtifie as a Qualification, gives no more to Faith than to other Works of Sanctification, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture doth peculiarly attribute our Juſtification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faith, and in a way of Oppoſition to all Works of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If you ſay, That Faith juſtifies only as an antecedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not at all meritorious, <hi>Virtute eompacti,</hi> then it's no more a Condition than our coming into the World, or Acts performed by us before Faith; and it gives no more to Faith than to the Works of Nature, as Worldly carnal Sorrow, Legal Repentance, and ſuch moral Acts as carnal and unregenerate Men daily perform; ſuch as you call your Preparatory diſpoſing Conditions, and they are the cauſe of Faith, as much as Faith of Juſtification, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the cauſes of Juſtification, <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt etiam cauſa cauſati,</hi> and are in <hi>in eodem genere cauſarum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Whatever juſtifies as a Foederal Condition is meritorious, but Faith juſtifying as a qualifying Condition, upon which Life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, juſtifies as a Foederal Condition. The <hi>Major</hi> is true, in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56391:150"/> the account of all; for the Condition need not to be adequate to the Reward in Intrinſick Value; tho' it be never ſo ſmall, yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Performance of the Condition the Reward is due Debt. And indeed all Conditions in Contracts and Covenants are proper meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſes, by vertue of the Compact and Agreement made between the Covenanters. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> If it juſtifies as a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Condition, it muſt juſtifie as a Foederal Condition, or meer Antecedent Condition: And if you ſay as an antecedent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it's at beſt but <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> which we call No Cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Scripture doth ſufficiently explain it ſelf in what it ſays of Juſtification by Faith, when it ſays we are redeemed, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, juſtified by Chriſt, by his Blood, by his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Spirit of God, when it ſays we are juſtified by Faith, intends not any Moral or Phyſical Cauſality in Faith as a Qualification, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue of it's Object. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the Holy Martyr rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth thus—
<q>
                              <p>As the <hi>Iſraeiltes</hi> were healed by beholding the Brazen Serpent, ſo are we ſaved by believing in Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Fox,</hi> p. 1659.</note> but the Looking up, of it ſelf did not procure Health to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but the Promiſe made in the Object, which was the Braſen Serpent, therefore in the ſame manner are we ſaved by our Faith and Spiritual looking upon the Body of Chriſt Crucified, not that the Action in it ſelf of Believing, as it is a quality in Man doth ſo deſerve, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it taketh that Dignity and Vertue from the Object Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56391:150"/> words in Scripture, <hi>juſtificari ex fidem, per fide,</hi> do betoken an Actual force and power in Faith to Juſtification; and then ſaith the Jeſuite, Faith is a Work; we are juſtified by Faith, <hi>Ergo,</hi> by a Work.</p>
                        <p>To this he adds, That Faith is our Juſtice it ſelf, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not the Apprehenſion only of Righteouſneſs: This he Builds on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</p>

                        <p>Now to avoid the Abſurditities, they are forced upon by the Proteſtant Arguments; they have two ſhifts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That this Merit is not from us but from God, becauſe Faith is the Gift of God's Grace, and therefore though we be juſtified by Merit, we are juſtified by Grace too, and that it is of Grace that our Faith Merits.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They ſay, That Faith Merits Juſtification, <hi>non ex condigno,</hi> of the worthineſs of it, but <hi>de congruo,</hi> of the fitneſs of it; and this is that which our <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſay, That it qualifies and diſpoſeth us to Juſtification, ſo that the juſtifying a Believer is the doing a thing that is fit and meet to be done, the Perſon being diſpoſed and qualified thereunto. It's ſad that Proteſtants ſhould now come to lick up the Papiſts Vomit, and re-aſſert thoſe groſs Errours in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths, that all our Orthodox and Famous Oppoſers of the Popiſh Hereſie have refuted and decryed by one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

To have ſaid thus unto them, That they muſt be juſtified by Chriſt, or by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and withal not to have plainly ſignified, what it is that God requires of them to give them part in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, without which they could not be juſtified, had been to caſt a Snare upon them, rather than open a Door of Life and Peace; and hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to prove, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, or Believing it ſelf, was Imputed unto him for Righteouſneſs, and he palliates it thus, That he underſtands it but as a means of coming at the Righteouſneſs, but he defends this Propoſition, That we are juſtified by Faith, <hi>ſenſu proprib non Metonymico.</hi>

In ſumm, their Opinion runs thus.</p>
                           <p>God in the Legal Covenant required exact Gbedience of his Commandment; but now in the Covenant of Grace he requires Faith, which in his gracious eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtands inſtead of that Obedience to the Moral Law, which we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: Which comes to paſs by the Merit of Chriſt, for whoſe ſake God accounts our imperfect Faith to be perfect Obedience. This Aſſertion [exactly Neonomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm] and in place thereof we defend this Propoſition.</p>
                           <p>God doth not Juſtifie a Man by Faith properly, imputing unto him Faith in Chriſt for his perfect Obedience to the Law, and therefore accounting him Juſt and Innocent in his ſight, which we prove by theſe Reaſons; I'll but name them.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We are not Juſtified by any Work of our own, [though given by Grace] but believing is an act of our own, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not by believing.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is manifeſt by Scripture, which teach we are ſaved by Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident, that Faith is a Work of ours; for though <hi>John</hi> 6.29. Chriſt ſaith this is the Work of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet our Adverſaries will not conclude thence that Faith is God's Work within us, and not our Work by his help; for they'l ſay, It's not God believes, and Chriſt repents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They have two ſhifts.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We are not Juſtified by any Work of our own, done by our own ſtrength, but by the Aid of Grace. <hi>A.</hi> This diſtinction of Works done without Grace, and Works done by Grace was deviſed by one that had neither Wit nor Grace, being a trick to elude the force of ſuch Scriptures as exclude them indefinitely to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore, its without all ground in Scripture thus to Interpret theſe Propoſitions: A Man is not Juſtified by Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Works done by the Power of Nature before and without Grace.</p>
                           <p>A Man is Juſtified by Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Works done by Aid of Grace.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They ſay, We are not Juſtified by any Works of our own, <hi>i. e.</hi> by any Works of the Law, but by a Work of the Goſpel ſuch as Faith is, we may be Juſtified by, there's no ground in Scripture for this diſtinction; nor in reaſon, for both tell us that Works commanded in the Law and in the Goſpel are one and the ſame for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. What Sin againſt the Goſpel that is not a Tranſgreſſion of the Law? Is Charity one, doth not the Law command it? Is Faith one, doth not the Law enjoyn the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But it commands not Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>A.</hi> It doth, for that which commands us in general to believe, commands us to believe whatever God ſhall make known to us.</p>

                           <p>Here our <hi>Neonomians</hi> will except and ſay, They differ from the <hi>Arminians</hi> in ſaying, That Chriſt only hath merited that our Imperfect Righteouſneſs ſhall be accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of perfect, which hath worſer abſurdity in it, as ſhall appear.</p>

                           <p>Juſtification is the Gracious Sentence of God, whereby for the ſake of Chriſt apprehended by Faith,<note place="margin">Ameſ. <hi>Medul. c.</hi> 27.</note> he abſolves a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever from Sin and Death, and counts him Righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 24.</p>

                           <p>I told you <hi>Neceſſary</hi> is not to be admitted as the Term of your Queſtion, becauſe it's Equivocal.

Let me put your Syllogiſm into intelligible Terms.</p>
                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:56391:156"/>
                           <p>That which God commands in order to Forgiveneſs, is a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Condition to Forgiveneſs; but God commands Repentance in order, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And here I deny the <hi>Major:</hi> For God commands Sinners to hear the Word, in order to Faith and Repentance; but hearing is not a qualifying Condition. <hi>Peter</hi> bids <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pray, That the Thoughts of his Heart may be forgiven, but not as a qualifying Condition to Pardon. So the anointing the Blind Man's Eyes with <hi>Clay</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi> was not a qualifying Condition for Healing antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, nor the touching of Chriſt by the Woman that had a Bloody Iſſue. Thoſe things that God doth, or commandeth us to do in order to receive Bleſſings, are means choſen by himſelf to give us the Bleſſings in, and both the Means and Bleſſings are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly provided in the Promiſe, the Fruit whereof is the Gift of both, even to will and to do.</p>
                           <p>But Repentance is required in order to Forgiveneſs: By this you may mean at leaſt in order thereto by way of meetneſs to fit a Man for Pardon before he hath it. To this I anſwer, You fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly change the term Juſtification into Forgiveneſs; for though Juſtification includes Forgiveneſs, yet Juſtification is not always meant by Forgiveneſs; for Juſtification is a ſingle Act of God, and a Perſon once Juſtified is always ſo; but by Forgiveneſs is meant often, eſpecially in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> a Renewal of the Sence of our Juſtified Eſtate, the ſhining of God's Face upon us after Falls and Relapſes into Sin; and thence we pray daily for Pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Suppoſition that when we pray for Pardon, we are not in a Juſtified Eſtate; neither do think when we have prayed for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, we are ever the whit more diſpoſed and fitted in God's ſight to receive it, but wait upon God for it with a great ſence of our Loathſomneſs and Unworthineſs in our ſelves, flying to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs to be covered with it in Believing, by which Imputed Righteouſneſs alone we look upon our ſelves as diſpoſed for Pardon.</p>
                           <p>Your places mentioned prove not what you deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> that in our firſt Forgiveneſs, which is our Juſtification, <hi>That Repentance is required as a diſpoſing condition to the receiving it. Acts</hi> 3.19. ſpeaks but of the Publick Manifeſtation of the Righteouſneſs of the Saints at the laſt day; not that they ſtand unjuſtified till that day, <hi>viz. the day of Refreſhing, and of Chriſt's ſecond Appearing,</hi> v. 20.</p>
                           <p>And as for that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. he commands Goſpel Duties but to be performed as Effects of the Promiſe, in performance of the Mercy promiſed; the words of the next Verſe ſhew, <hi>For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56391:156"/> belongeth to you, therefore Repent;</hi> and Repentance is there no more a diſpoſition to Forgiveneſs than Baptiſm; and the end of that Ordinance is to ſhew that Forgiveneſs belongs to us already, for it's the Seal of the Promiſe; and to be Baptized into Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no more than to be Baptized into the Seal and Confirmation of the Covenant of Promiſe or Forgiveneſs, which you believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to you, as the Covenant is called the <hi>Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Acts</hi> 7.8. And a Seal is not of a Pardon to be wrote, but of that which is Wrote and Signed already.</p>

                              <hi>Repentance is a Grace to which Pardon is promiſed; and upon the working of it Forgiveneſs is given, and Impenitency continues Guilt where-ever it reigns.</hi> D. W. p. 115.</p>

                           <p>Forgiveneſs is promiſed to Perſons, not to Graces and Qualifications.

God ſaith, He had pardoned <hi>David</hi> before he Repented; and what was it that moved him ſo kindly to Repentance, as is mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. but the ſence of Pardon? The Lord had told him by <hi>Nathan</hi> that he had put away his Sin.</p>

                           <p>As to that place of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. it hath been ſpoken to already. It ſuppoſeth not that they had any Qualification for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by Repentance, for they were to make them a new Heart firſt; a Condemned Sinner beſure can never do that work, nor work at it. God muſt perform the Promiſe of Grace in breaking his Heart of Stone by the Revelation of Pardoning Mercy, and make him a new Heart before he can have a Heart to Repent. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. imports no more than that the Goſpel is the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> and thereby Sinners are raiſed from <hi>Darkneſs to Light, i. e.</hi> from the Darkneſs of a Natural State to the Light of Grace, thereby in Chriſt's own Light they ſee Light; the words are <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>
                           <hi>That though neither Holineſs, ſincere Obedience or good Works do make any Atonement for ſin, or are in the leaſt meritorious Righteouſneſs, whereby Salvation is cauſed; or for which this or any Bleſſing becomes due to us by Debt; yet as the Spirit of God freely worketh all Holineſs, and enableth to ſincere Obedience and good Works; ſo the Lord Jeſus hath of his own Grace, and for his own Merits, promiſed to bring to Heaven, ſuch as are Partakers of true Holineſs, perform his ſincere Obedience, and do thoſe good Works perſeveringly.</hi>

                        <p>You allow Chriſt the Honour of Atonement for Sin; but how far I know not, by what follows; his Atonement reacheth not the Breach of the new Law Conditions, but only ſo far as
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56391:162"/> refers to Sins againſt the Old Law, of which you will not allow, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and Unbelief be a breach; ſo that there muſt be ſome way in the new Law found out to expiate and appeaſe God for them without Chriſt's Atonement: Beſide, the Conditions of it, it being only imperfect Obedience, there will need nothing but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conſtituted Condition, which whether perfect or imperfect, being performed as well as is required, tho' ſinfully imperfect, leaves no place for Sacrifice or Atonement; hence you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to have merited Bleſſings with the ſame Reſerve, which you are not willing to ſpeak out, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt hath purchaſed and merited, that we ſhall come under new and milder Terms with God, or God rather with us: We thank you no more than we do the Papiſts, for ſaying, Chriſt hath merited all, and is a cauſe, even as the Creation was of the Covenant of Works. God's the Cauſe of all, for he made all; ſo Chriſt hath merited all that follows, whatever new Laws and Conditions follow, and upon which Terms Benefits become due to us [you ſhould have ſaid to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind] by Debt. We may challenge the Priviledges of compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God upon ſuch Terms as we like better than the former; but our Failure in performing thoſe Terms that Chriſt agreed for, will bring us under new Arrearages to God. And for your ſaying, the holy Spirit worketh freely the ſaid conditional Holineſs, it helps not, which notwithſtanding your ſetting aſide the Word <hi>Merit,</hi> is truly fo <hi>virtute compacti,</hi> tho' not <hi>valoris intrinſeci,</hi> as much as <hi>Adam</hi>'s would have been. And as to the Spirit, you aſcribe the free giving and working of it; you give no more to it than <hi>Adam</hi> had in the ſtate of Innocency; and not ſo much; for God had given and wrought in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that Perfection and Strength of Grace, whereby he might have ſtood, if he would. You ſay, There is a Promiſe made by Chriſt of Glory, upon Condition of their good Works and Perſeverance. Your Suggeſtion to us is of two Covenants of Grace procured by Chriſt for us: One, the Promiſe of the ſtate of Grace and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, provided we fulfil the Conditions of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby we have the firſt Juſtification. The Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is of a ſtate of Glory, upon condition of Perſeverance in good Works; which condition if we fail of, we loſe all the Bleſſings of Eternal Life: So that our Glorification ſtands upon more hazardous Terms than Eternal Life did to <hi>Adam;</hi> for upon one good Work he ſhould have entred into full Poſſeſſion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and a Confirmation therein; whereas we muſt ſtand upon the Teſt all our days, and may loſe all at laſt; for the Works muſt be performed perſeveringly, or elſe no Penny for all the <hi>Paternoſters.</hi>

                        <p>Gentlemen, you ſee how well Truth is ſtated here. 1. Chriſt hath promiſed to bring to Heaven ſuch as are Partakers of Holineſs, as a condition of his ſecond new Law: As if the Promiſe of Eternal Life were not at once the Promiſe of the Life of Grace and Glory. 2. His way and means is a conditional qualifying means, obtaining the Promiſe foederally. 3. His means are two, Sincerity and Perſeverance: Sincerity muſt not be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Hypocriſie; for tho other Qualifications be imperfect, yet Sincerity muſt be perfect, and muſt give Perfection to all the reſt Foederally. But a Man is not confirmed in the ſtate of Grace, nor is it ſecured by one, two, or a Hundred ſincere Works. His Sincerity is not a Condition to be depended upon if he perſevere not; if he fall into Evil Works, or perform not good Works ſincerely, his Heart hath been Hypocritical, he's gone for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he muſt begin again to be ſincere and perſevere, but will loſe his Condition and his Hope upon it ſo often, that he is perſwaded at laſt to leave tyring himſelf, to get and keep ſincerity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſincere Works, that he thinks it the beſt way to give it over till he is going to die; that he hath no more to do than the Thief upon the Croſs; for he reckons he can be ſincere there for a ſpurt to help him at a dead Lift, and hath nothing elſe to do, and it will be no long work for him. And thus your Doctrine comes to be the greateſt Doctrine of Looſeneſs and Prophaneneſs: Your unperformable Foederal Conditions, putting Men upon an utter deſpair of ever attaining to any true allowable Holineſs. And it ſeems theſe are undiſpenſible Qualifications. The meaning of this can be no other, but a falling away from a ſtate of Grace; for if Indiſpenſable, then a Breach of theſe Conditions is not to be diſpenſed with. Now I ſay, if ſincere Obedience and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be indiſpenſible Qualifications, after a Man hath begun in ſincere Obedience, and continued ſome time, and then fall into Hypocriſie, or ſome ſuch Sin as <hi>David</hi>'s, which was Profaneneſs; or ſome ſuch Sin as <hi>Aſa</hi>'s, which was Perſecution; and <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in denial of his Maſter: Theſe are Sins of Rebellion: What muſt ſuch an one conclude? And what elſe can you now ſay to him,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56391:163"/> but that he is fallen from the Bleſſing, and promiſed Heaven? He is in a ſtate of Damnation: All his former Faith and Obedience is loſt. What ſhall a Miniſter ſay to him now under the deepeſt Sence of Sin? Saith he, I am certainly damned, I have fallen ſhort of an indiſpenſible Qualification for Heaven. Nay, you tell me, Chriſt doth exclude thoſe that have any want of Sincerity and Perſeverance, or ſuch as have neglected it.</p>

I would ſay to him, Go, and repent, and believe, and perſevere again in ſincere Obedience, and they you will ſee how it is; but never be ſo preſumptuous as to believe you ſhall be ſaved till you have perſevered, and all your Comfort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lies upon this.</hi>

If we muſt obtain Salvation by good Works, we muſt do good Works before we are Saved: Do we not obtain all Salvation in Chriſt? <hi>We are Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works;</hi> but I find you'll have nothing to be Salvation but Glorification, and that muſt be Earn'd at our Fingers ends, and we may loſe all at laſt for all Chriſt, if we do not look the better to it, to perform ſincere perſevering Works till the laſt Breath; the firſt Juſtification though by Works, gives no Evidence for Heaven, you'll be ſure to be far enough from the Errour (as you call it) of Faith Juſtifying Evidentially.

                        <p n="4">4. He doth not only ſuggeſt but expreſs falling away from Grace, for what is that when he ſuggeſts an Elect Perſon may fall away from Grace, turn Apoſtate, and loſe Heaven?</p>
                        <p n="5">5.

<q>Certainly not only the Works of the Ceremonial Law, but all Works are at once excluded, or elſe the Antitheſis of Mercy would ſignifie nothing here.

                        <p>What a Reflection is on the Wiſdom, Grace and Power of God, that he cannot beſtow his Benefits freely, that he can act no way towards poor ſinful and miſerable Creatures, but in a way of Juſtice, in propounding Rewards to their Works; and theſe muſt be the Motives to Duty, that he will pay them well for their Duties! And what Reflection on the whole Work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all that Sinners have got by it, is the Procurement of an Offer of Salvation in a Covenant of Works, by offering them to live upon the condition of <hi>doing;</hi> to allow him to have purchaſed Benefits, but we muſt pay for them before we have them, and not be out of Debt at the firſt payment neither. Chriſt indeed, you'll ſay, gives us the Buying, and ſaith, that he'll get little or nothing by it. He hath ſet a moderate reaſonable Price upon them, but we muſt pay in ſuch Money as we have; yea, and all that we have: And becauſe we have not the Money to lay down
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56391:167"/> at once, he admits us to pay by Parts, (which is a Favour;) but if we make a Failure, that we perſevere not in ſincere Doing, out of Doors we muſt go: Reprobate Silver ſhall we be called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath rejected us. Your meaning of a Rectoral way I take to be nothing elſe but in a way of Diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, diſpenſing as King and Law-giver in the Covenant of Grace, making and executing this Law, <hi>Do</hi> and <hi>live;</hi> for you will not have the Covenant of Grace to run in this Tenure, <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt act no otherwiſe, than in a Covenant of Works, <hi>Do</hi> and <hi>live,</hi> and accordingly diſpenſe Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinners have much to do in order to Salvation: It's the ſcope of the Bible ſince the Fall. We have nothing to do in a way of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Purchaſe, but in order to our Participation, we must repent, believe. All the Revelations of God are Deſcriptions of Duty and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but an Injunction of Duty in a Connection with benefits,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>The whole Scope of the Scriptures is not a Revelation of a Covenant of Works, or of many Covenants of Works, but of one Law-Covenant of Works, and of one Covenant of Grace made by way of Promiſe, and executed by Free-gift; the Righteouſneſs thereof is the Gift of Righteouſneſs for the Condition; the Promiſe is performed in Gift; <hi>The Gift of God is eternal life,</hi> Rom. 5. You ſay nothing is required in a way of Purchaſe and Atonement, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the way of the firſt Purchaſe: But where Works are a prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Condition, it makes a ſecond Purchaſe, if but of Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I purchaſe a Houſe for a Child or Relation, and lay down the price of 100 <hi>l.</hi> and tell him he ſhall have this Houſe if he gives me 20 Shillings of his own Earnings, and this Contract brought into Covenants, this Purchaſe will put him upon paying this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract-Money, and demand his Bargain; and his Money is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Money, tho' it be not the firſt Purchaſe-money. So that you help not the matter at all, by ſaying <hi>in order to Participation;</hi>
                           <pb n="273" facs="tcp:56391:167"/> and as to Atonement, he needs none, if he perform the Condition required; no, nor a Mediator; for Chriſt in your ſence ſhould be only the Mediator of the Old Covenant, but he is ill termed by the Scripture the Mediator of the New Covenant. You ſay, Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Deſcriptions of Duties and Benefits; I ſay, Diſcoveries and Promiſe of Benefits and Duties. You ſay, an Injunction of Duty in a Connection of Benefits; I ſay, a Promiſe of Benefits, rather with Connection of Duties. But indeed, the Covenant of Grace is an Offer and Gift of Benefits in Service and Enjoyments: For Duty is one of the great Priviledges we are brought into by the Covenant; and ſuch is the Connection of promiſed Salvation unto Sinners. There's the Salvation of Faith and Holineſs, and all the connex Propoſitions that is made uſe of, as that <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. and others import nothing, but that he that is ſaved by Chriſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of all his Salvation; if in Juſtification, then in Sanctification and Glorification; but Chriſt never propounds Priviledges as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Duty in your ſence, by way of Payment or Reward for the Duty done.</p>

And therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, ſuch Unbelievers are condemned already, they remain under the Power and Sentence of the firſt Condemnation. Neither is the Deſtruction of Sinners laid to their <hi>not doing,</hi> but <hi>not believing</hi> in Chriſt. Believing is oppoſed to Doing, becauſe God will not have us to be ſaved by Doing. And when a Sinner comes, he is not ſaved by his Act in Coming, but by Chriſt to whom he is come. Neither doth he come till he is ſaved by the Father's drawing him; and Chriſt finding every Sinner before he comes, ſhews that he is a loſt Sinner, and never comes to Salvation, till Salvation comes to him.</p>

                        <p>Your Argument ſeems to run thus: Upon the ſame Terms that Man ſhall be judged at the laſt Day, upon the ſame ſhall they be ſaved now: But Men ſhall be judged by their Works at the laſt Day, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaved by Works now.</p>
                        <p>I deny your <hi>Major:</hi> If that were true, you might have ſome Pretence, that the Covenant of Grace was a Covenant of Works. There's a great deal of difference between Chriſt's proceedings in the Covenant of Grace, and the Judgment of the Laſt Day. 1. Chriſt in Covenant of Grace comes not as a Judge to <hi>condemn the World,</hi> but to <hi>ſave it.</hi> 2. Chriſt firſt ſaves his Church, and exerts his Offices in that Salvation, firſt, as Prieſt, to make Atonement; as Prophet, to teach by his Word and Spirit; as King, to conquer and ſubdue their Hearts unto himſelf, and all this is done before he rules and governs them. 3. Chriſt in the Covenant of Grace acts not in his Regal Power, as King of the World, but as King to his Church; his Mediatorial Offices are all exerted towards his Redeemed ones, in order to the ſaving of them. All final Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56391:168"/> are judged as ſuch as are under the Condemnation of the Law; and their Sins only judged the more aggravated, becauſe of their refuſal of a Remedy. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven in Plaming Fire, <hi>taking Vengeance upon them that know not God, and thoſe that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſlighting and rejecting a Remedy offer'd, is a ground of more ſevere proceeding in the way of Execution of the Sentence which the condemned Perſon lay under before. <hi>How ſhall ye eſcape, that neglect ſo great Salvation.</hi> The Talents mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.21, 24, 28. refer only to the diſtinction that appears between Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Some act from common Grace only, ſome by ſpecial Grace: Some are carried no further than common Grace will carry them, and therefore bring not forth real Fruit unto God, and are not in Chriſt Jeſus, have only common Graces and Gifts.</p>

                           <hi>I could eaſily demoſtrate, that if men have nothing to do in order to Salvation, the Miniſtry of Chriſt and his Apoſtles — is all Vanity and Falſhood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are cold Pleadings with Sinners that are not backed with Life and Death.</hi>

                        <p>It's eaſie to demoſtrate that an unſaved Perſon can do nothing in order to Salvation; and if they can, the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is falſe. For Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing;</hi> and <hi>we are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>created in him to good Works,</hi> and Chriſt worketh in us <hi>to will and to do:</hi> All this is Salvation. The firſt true Motive to a Sinner is the Salvation wrought by Chriſt already for Sinners, in his Death and Satisfaction: The Promiſe of Heaven is a Secondary Motive; but is not to be brought as a Primary Motive. The rendring Life and Death to working or not working is the preaching of the Law, and of the Letter, and makes the Goſpel ſuch a Law as is the Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Condemnation. And to conclude my Anſwer to the Proof of that Poſition,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That Sinners have much to do in order to Salvation:</hi> And to prove it in the Negative, I offer this Argument:</p>
                        <p>They that can do nothing in order to Salvation till they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have not much to do in order to Salvation: But Sinners can do nothing in order to Salvation till they are ſaved, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath not much to do in order to Salvation in your Sence. I leave you to conſider of it, and the Evidence of it; for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but apprehend the Demonſtration that is therein; for doing muſt be here underſtood effective: Such Works you ſpeak of, as appears by what follows.</p>

Chriſt alſo governs his Church, where he hath his peculiar Right of Legiſlation, and his Government is double. 2. As to his Myſtical or Viſible Body, his Spiritual Rule is according to the Tenure of the Covenant of Grace. His Government in reſpect of the mixt and politick State, muſt be alſo mixt, becauſe of Hypocriſie. Chriſt's Government of his Churches as Viſible Polities and Societies, is a mixt Government, having in his Houſe Veſſels of Honour and of Diſhonour: Many are led to external Conformity by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Commands legally ſubmitted to only, having not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Evangelical Principles. <hi>Quicquid recipitur recipitur ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum recipientis.</hi> Precepts and Promiſes of the Goſpel work no otherwiſe with them than by a Spirit of Bondage, and come to them no otherwiſe than in the Tenure of the Covenant of Works: And thence the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in that manner to whole Societies and Churches, both under the Old Teſtament, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New. As to the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where there were many formal out-ſide Profeſſors, that never received the Truth of the Goſpel in the love of it, he tells them what they muſt expect in that mercenary and bondage-way of Profeſſion without Life and Love, wherein they did walk; yet he governs them as Politick Head of his Church, they having given themſelves to his Government, at leaſt in an outward Profeſſion, according to which he deals with them. And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, the Law is not made for the Righteous Man, in reſpect of it's Threats and Denunciations, but for the Lawleſs, Diſobedient, Ungodly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or for any thing contrary to ſound Doctrine, which is according to the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.10, 11. The Precepts and Commands of Chriſt therefore have a double Aſpect, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Legal, as they are received by his Viſible Subjects. Some receive them from Law-Principles, ſome from Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>

Indeed it did not admit of Repentance as an Expiation of the Sin, and a Condition of Life, no more doth the Goſpel; ſo that Law and Goſpel are agreed in that. 3.

Legal; for it makes a Covenant of Works. What matter if God require not the ſame Individual Act as a Condition of Life, if he require another? What, if inſtead of forbearing to eat an Apple, the Condition be now to forbear the eating of a Pear? What if perfect Obedience was then required, and imperfect now? Both were Obedience; only now you'll have a Diſpenſation for Sin to come into the Condition, which reflects upon the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, or Power of God, that he did not, nor could give us Life in a way of perfect Obedience and ſinleſs, but muſt have Recourſe to ſinful. Likewiſe the only Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that lies upon a meer natural Man to obey God, when he commands Faith and Repentance, is the Law; for he is under no other Law but that of Works. 2. It is alſo ſuper-legal, (1.) To bring fallen Man into Covenant upon working Conditions, is more than was with <hi>Adam;</hi> he did not work himſelf into Covenant; God took him freely into Covenant without Conditions; all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was Perſeverance for keeping him in Covenant, as yours is. (2.) God here requires Works where there's no Power. God gave <hi>Adam</hi> the Power before he required Obedience.</p>

                        <p>Why do you ſay, <hi>Whether God require any more?</hi> As if this was ſo little. I tell you, this is more than he required of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency by Faith and Repentance [according to your ſelf;] he required nothing but Perſeverance in him, when he had Life and Ability to act from and by it; but you will have a poor impotent dead Sinner do all this for Life. 2. You ſay, If we do ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we perform this as part of Salvation, we cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, our own Works are our Security from periſhing. And as to other things neceſſary to Salvation, Chriſt hath provided them. So that the Work is divided betwixt us, part of it to us, and part to Chriſt: But however, if Chriſt hath not made ſo certain Proviſion for us, and made any Default on his part, we are ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Salvation by doing of ours: For the Promiſe ſecures Life to us upon our doing theſe. If this is not to make the Goſpel a more over-grown and ſwinging Covenant of Works than ever the Old Law was, I have loſt all my Theological Meaſures. And here we have the main difference between the firſt and laſt, that Chriſt ſtands by to ſee what's wanting: But his great buſineſs is to ſee us ſaved by our own Works from firſt to laſt. As for Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56391:174"/> Good Works, ſincere perſevering Obedience, internal and external, they are our Foederal Conditions, upon the Performance whereof the Promiſe of all Salvation in Juſtification and Adoption and Glorification is due Debt to us; and if Chriſt hath done any thing for us, it's due to us upon theſe Terms, whatever he hath provided beſides.</p>

And I think all Men are ſo, till Chriſt finds any, by giving Faith and Repentance to them, for which end he is exalted: And theſe are the Sheep of his, which he hath promiſed ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come into his Fold; theſe are among the chiefeſt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, before they ever have Faith and Repentance. The <hi>Lo-ammi, who ſhall become the Children of the living God.</hi> Ay, but you ſay, will any Decree or Merits of Chriſt ſecure them? ſo that every poor Impenitent Unbelieving Sinner is in a deſperate Condition: There's no Decree of God, nor Merits of Chriſt can ſave them: So that both Decree and Merits were all conditional, provided he believe, neither Decree or Merits can ſecure Salvation to him. And do they not ſecure Faith and Repentance as part of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſo one part as well as another, and upon the ſame Terms?</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56391:175"/> wherefore is all this but to ſhew, that our Security of ſtanding and keeping in Covenant with God, and of all our Salvation, lies not on Electing Grace, nor on the Merits of Chriſt, but on our own Works of Faith and Obedience. The Reſolution of theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſay, according to the Scope of the Word, will decide the Main of this Controverſie; and I will tell you how much they concern the matter in hand. As to the firſt:</p>
                        <p>If a Man have a Healthy Body, and ſtrength of Nature to live till Fourſcore Years of Age, he ſhall not die a young Man. And whether, if he take the Care of his own Health and Safety, God hath not provided every thing elſe for him? Or thus: If a Man get a good Eſtate, and hold it till he dies, whether this Man can die a poor Man? But our Queſtion rightly put, runs thus, Seeing God hath provided by his Decree or Promiſe, that this or that Sinner ſhall have true Grace, and he that hath it, ſhall never final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe it; whether his Perſeverance and Security depends upon his Works and Actings, or upon the Decree and Promiſe? The Aſſembly, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. of the <hi>Perſeverance of the Saints,</hi> ſaith,—
<q>They that are effectually called ſhall not finally fall from the ſtate of Grace, but certainly perſevere; which Perſeverance depends not upon their own Free Will, but upon the Immutability of the Decree of Election — The Efficacy of the Merit and Interceſſion of Chriſt — The abiding of the Spirit, the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, from which ariſeth the Certainty and Infallibility thereof.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to your ſecond Appeal, it hath as much as this in it; If a Man get up to the top of the Monument, and throw himſelf down from thence, he will certainly break his Neck. Or thus; If a good Angel fall into Pride and Sin as <hi>Belzebub</hi> did, he will be laid in Chains of Darkneſs in the ſame manner as he. If <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould blaſpheme God, he would be tumbled out of Heaven. If a Man wax on Wings to his Shoulders, and fly towards the Sun like <hi>Icharus,</hi> the Wax melts, and down comes he headlong. Such Propoſitions as theſe are the Rules of Chriſts Rectoral Diſtribution with you, and the Decree comes not in oppoſition; whereas the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſpoils the Hypotheſis; for do but aſſume upon the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you will find it ſo, that the Decree ſpoils it as to the Event.</p>
                        <p>God's Rule of Government is not a Propoſition founded upon an Impoſſibility, <hi>Poſito Decreto;</hi> neither is his Decree as you would make it, ſubſervient to his Rule of Government, but all his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Rules thereof are founded on, and guided according to his good Will and pleaſure in his Decree.</p>
                        <p>What you quote out of the Aſſembly's Confeſſion, is <hi>nihil ad Rhombum,</hi> but all againſt you; for none denies God's Approbation
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56391:175"/> of our Obedience, the great Uſes and Ends of it, the acceptation of it, and rewarding it in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c. ut ſupra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ends and Uſes which they mention is not amiſs to repeat, becauſe you charge the ſame Aſſertion on Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> for his great Errour.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Aſſemb. Ch.</hi> 16. Good Works done in obedience to God's Commands, are the Fruits and Evidences of a true and lively Faith, and by them Believers make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their Thankfulneſs, ſtrengthen their Aſſurance, edifie their Brethren, adorn the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſtop the Mouths of Adverſaries, and glorifie God, whoſe Workmanſhip they are, created in Chriſt Jeſus thereunto; that having their Fruit unto Holineſs, they may have the end, Eternal Life.</q>
                        <p>And as for Dr. <hi>O.</hi> whom you quote from <hi>p.</hi> 222. <hi>Of Justification,</hi> he is there diſputing againſt theſe Tenents of yours, and grants the like Uſes and Ends of our Perſonal Righteouſneſs as the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that it's indiſpenſably required by God, he approves of it and accepts it in Chriſt, it evidenceth Faith, it's pleadable againſt Satan and the World. And after ſome explication of his meaning in theſe things, he ſaith, — <q>Hence it appears how little force there is in that Argument, which ſome pretend to be of ſo great weight in this Cauſe, [among them you are one.] As every one, ſay they, ſhall be judged of God at the laſt Day, in the ſame way and manner, and on the ſame grounds, is he juſtified of God in this Life; but by Works, and not by Faith alone every one ſhall be judged at the laſt Day: Wherefore by VVorks, and not by Faith alone, every one is juſtified before God in this Life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This he anſwers, and condemns the following Propoſition, or not far from it.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>That God pardons Men's Sins, gives them the Adoption of Children, with a right to an Heavenly Inheritance according to their VVorks, which (ſaith he) is not only Foreign to she Goſpel, but deſtructive of it. And you ſay, that Forgiving, Adopting and Glorifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Judicial Acts of God as a Rector, is in a way of recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſtribution of Rewards.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Luth.</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. ſaith, VVorks done without Faith are under a Curſe, though they have never ſo good a ſhew of Holineſs: Wherefore ſo far off is it, that the Doers thereof deſerve Grace, Righteouſneſs and Eternal Life, that rather they heap Sin upon Sin. After this manner the Pope works, and all Merit-mongers.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, he deals with me as (you have found upon Examination) he hath done formerly—
<q>I was Preaching upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. and was ſhewing, That Zeal of God proves not a Man a Child of God,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 144, 148.</note> and I told them, All aim at this, that you Build not upon Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations that will fail you, when you come to tryal, there is abſolutely perfection enough in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone for your Reſt and Security, that you ſhall not need to truſt to any thing you do for Life and Peace. This is that which God calls you to, to go torth from your own Righteouſneſs, to reſt ſolely and only upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, if ever you mean to have Comfort in this World, or in the World to come. I anſwered this Objection; you will ſay, This is the way to deſtroy all Righteouſneſs and Obedience whatſoever: What a Man never a jot the better, though never ſo zealous after God, though his Eye and aim be after God in his Zeal! <hi>A.</hi> The World is grown to a miſerable paſs that Obedience, Zeal, and ſeeking after God be of no uſe at all, except a Man himſelf be a Gainer by his Obedience; it's now as it was in the time of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Every one will be ready to cry out, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> And if any thing be propoſed to Men to be done, they anſwer, But what ſhall I get by it? Every one will be ready to ſhun ſuch an Office or Employment that carry about with them a great deal of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and expence of time, and brings in no profit. —I muſt tell you freely,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56391:176"/> There's not one Duty you perform, when you have attained the higheſt pitch, that hath any prevalency and availableneſs to produce and to bring forth any, though the leaſt good to your ſelves. You ought not to think to ſeek again to your ſelves by doing, or bring Chriſt to your ſelves by doing; <hi>You are not your own,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>but you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your Bodies and Spirits.</hi> Chriſt hath redeemed us that we ſhould not henceforth live to our ſelves, but to Chriſt that died for us.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in this Diſcourſe I intend theſe things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That our Duties ought not to Rob Chriſt's Righteouſneſs of the procuring vertue it hath of all the Bleſſings and Good that we have.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That we ought not to perform Duties from a Mercenary Principle, thinking thereby to obtain good things of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That we reſt not in the Duty done.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That Duties barely conſidered in themſelves, though of the higheſt Nature, are not available to obtain any thing of God, for what will our Righteouſneſs profit him? <hi>And when we have done all we are unprofitable Servants,</hi> and have done leſs than we ought to do; therefore there's no reaſon from our beſt Duties why God ſhould beſtow any good thing upon us.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That we ſhould do Duties from a gracious Spirit of Ingenuity, for the Glory of God, and Free Grace, not from a poor, narrow, and ſelfiſh Spirit. Not but that I am for Duty in a right manner, and for a right end.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>He intends to forbid our intending our own Good, though in ſubordination to God's Glory, and laying no ſtreſs of meriting; for (ſaith he) People may think here's a marvellous diſcouragement to Perſons, to do what God calls them to do, when they ſhall have nothing for it. I anſwer, When there is a Spirit of Ingenuity they ſhall be as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to glorifie God, to do good to Men, as if they did it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They ſhall do as much for Good already beſtowed, as if they were to procure it by their own doing.</hi>

                        <p>Is this not to intend my own Good, whereas it's not only to intend it, but to attend it, and walk in the higheſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Enjoyment of it? as when <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> paſs'd mutual Complements; <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have enough;</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have all.</hi> It is as plain as may be made, 1. That we ſhould in all we do mind and aim at the Glory of God, and Honour of Free Grace. For I ſaid,
<q>Except you mind chiefly, that all the Duties you perform are for other Ends and Purpoſes than your Preferment; <hi>viz.</hi> The ſetting forth the praiſe of the Glory of Free Grace, and the ſerving the Generation in which you live, and the ſtudy of good Works, becauſe they are profitable to Men. I ſay, Except you fall upon the performance of good Duties for the common good and benefit, without having any
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56391:177"/> ſuch Conceits, as what ſhall accrue to you thereby; you are not Perſons yet come to have that common Spirit, and dead to the old Spirit, as becomes Chriſtians.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay here, <hi>chiefly,</hi> and therefore am not to be underſtood, as if I did mean, as Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſaith, to forbid all intending our own good, but rather act as one that now hath nothing to do in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; as to the ſecuring of Spiritual good things to my ſelf, Chriſt hath procured and ſettled all upon me. <hi>I have a goodly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall follow me all my days;</hi> and from the ſence of the greatneſs and fulneſs of Proviſion made for me in Chriſt; I will glorifie him in Soul, and Body, and Spirit, live to him, ſerve him, and my Generation, not thinking that I can add any thing by my Duties to what Chriſt hath procured and obtained for me; and in this ſence it is, I ſay, that it is no diſcouragement becauſe you cannot propound to your ſelf any poſſible Gain, [<hi>i. e.</hi> over and above what Chriſt hath procured,] but whatever is the greateſt and trueſt ſpur, or encouragement to Duty, is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to your Hand freely and graciouſly. I illuſtrate my meaning thus.</p>
                        <q>There are ſome Children in the World that are very obſervant of their Parents;<note place="margin">Dt. <hi>C.</hi> p. 151.</note> and their aim is, that by reaſon of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance their Parents may ſettle an Eſtate upon them; but when a Child knows an Eſtate is already ſettled upon him, that it cannot be reverſed, and he is not able to add to it, will ſuch a Child propoſe to himſelf in his Obedience and Obſervance, the obtaining that Good his Father hath already paſſed? He knows it is paſſed already, and cannot be by any thing he doth, firmer and ſtronger. He ſerves not now to get his Fathers Land, but he ſerves to glorifie his Father that hath ſo freely ſettled his Land upon him.</q>
                        <p>[Hence you ſee plainly that I mean in reſpect of Title, not in reſpect of Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment, for] ſo I ſay of Believers that have the temper of Chriſt's true-bred Children indeed.</p>
                        <q>They in the Goſpel of Chriſt find all things that do appertain to Life and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they find them all ſo paſſed over by God's Goodneſs and Free Grace to them,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 152.</note> 
                           <hi>That the Lions ſhall want and ſuffer hunger, before they ſhall want any thing that is good.</hi> Muſt they now labour to gain theſe things as if they were in agitation, or as if they were yet refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their will, or to their good and evil walking, that as they ſhall walk ſo they ſhall ſpeed? This is to argue. That God is yet to determine with himſelf how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thoſe good things that he will beſtow upon his People, and that he gives good things according to their good or evil Carriage; and ſo the goodneſs of God to his People muſt depend upon his Peoples goodneſs to him [which is as the <hi>Morning Cloud;</hi>] and as Mens Works prevail with God, ſo God will pour out his Bounty upon them.</q>

                        <p>The great things that the Faithful mentioned in that Chapter did by Faith in the Promiſe, ſurely Entitling them to thoſe great things they looked for; they did not eſteem that their Obedience added one grain to their Inheritance by Promiſe, any more than that the very Service of God it ſelf, and Enjoyment of him was of the Priviledges promiſed, and they walked therein in Expectation of further performances. <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for a City; upon what ground? Not of his Obedience, but as being Heir al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of the Promiſe of it. <hi>Moſes</hi> had an Eye to the <hi>Recompence of Reward,</hi> not as procuring it by his Self-denial, but as being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to it by the Promiſe believed, as already beſtowed upon him by the Gift and Procurement of Chriſt, and thence was carried forth to his Duty in Love to God, and in Honour of his Free Grace, as I have ſaid; thence it was that no difficulties of Affliction could diſcourage him, nor Worldly Preferments and Riches allure him from his Duty.</p>
                        <p>My whole deſign in the Expreſſions mentioned by Mr. <hi>Neonom.</hi> was to caution Believers againſt putting their Duties in the place of Chriſt in order to Life and Salvation.

And I neither take from good Works their praiſe, nor commend evil Works; but in the matter of Juſtification, I ſay, we muſt look how we may hold Chriſt, leſt while we ſeek to be Juſtified by the Law, we make him unprofitable to us; for it's Chriſt alone that Juſtifieth me, both againſt my evil Deeds, and without my good Deeds. If I have this perſwaſion of Chriſt, I lay hold on the true Chriſt; but if I think that he exacteth the Law and Works of me to Salvation, then he becometh unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, and I am utterly ſeparated from him.</q>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56391:178"/> yet the ſecond part doth not run full enough, it ſhould run thus; From this Motive of the Love of God, the Promiſe of Grace, and the procurement made by Jeſus Chriſt, entitling us to all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Goſpel, we ought to perform Holy Duties and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, growing in all Grace, with an Eye to the Enjoyment of that full Inheritance provided for us in Grace and Glory, aſcribing all to the Glory of Free Grace, and nothing to the procurements of our own Works. And therefore I ſay, none ought to propoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf in reſpect of Title to the Bleſſings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by any Duty he performs, being Heir of the Promiſe by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, all the Promiſes being in him <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought he to propound profit from any Duty as ſuch only, but in and thorough Chriſt, and in whom every Duty is accepted, and from whom we receive the Benefit; for whatever we ask it's in his Name, and for his ſake alone, (not for our Duties ſake) we receive it. And that it is vain and unlawful to do any thing with an Eye to our Spiritual or Eternal good, as a proper Effect by way of Remuneration of our Duty performed, for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in Subordination to God's Glory in Chriſt, but a Robbing of him.</p>

                        <p>This Arguing would well enough become a Papiſt, but it is ſtrange at this time a day from the Mouth of a Proteſtant, but it's eaſie to ſee the Devil is at work to betray us again into our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> our Mouths hang too generally after the Leeks and Onions of their Corrupt Doctrine. Now we muſt go to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terms of the Old Law, for Life, not <hi>Finalitèr,</hi> as aimed
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56391:181"/> at and travelled to as <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> taken for Glory, but for Life as a <hi>Premium</hi> of our Works. That this is intended by you clearly appears by the Application that you make of this place of Scripture, as if it Juſtified the Doctrine of Merit. The Diſciples hearing our Saviours diſcourſe concerning a Rich Man, and how hard it is for him to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, they were amazed, and ſaid, <hi>Who then ſhall be ſaved? Peter</hi> hence concludes then ſurely poor Men may better be ſaved; we are poor enough, and have leſt all for thee; what ſhall we have? And there is no doubt but ſomething as yet remained in them of that legal Spirit as prevailed in and among the <hi>Jews,</hi> expecting or enquiring after ſome proportionable Reward to their Sufferings, which Spirit was not fully removed from them till after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſending down of the Spirit, when they came clearly to ſee the Grace of Chriſt in the Goſpel, but it was not Chriſt's time yet to remove all Clouds and Obſcurities from the Doctrine of the Goſpel; he did it not in his own Miniſtry, it was to be the Work of the Comforter, the Spirit, as peculiarly belonging to his Office after Chriſt's Aſcenſion. As yet they had not askt any thing in his Name, neither did Chriſt in the platform of Prayer teach them ſo to do; as yet they were ſtrangers to the Myſtery of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt; as yet they looked that the Kingdom of Chriſt would immediately be a Temporal and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Now the anſwer of our Saviour imports theſe things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That none ſhall loſe any thing by following him, though in parting with worldly advantages.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That thoſe Bleſſings that he beſtows upon his true Followers, are of another Nature than they expected; they were of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. and of a Spiritual Nature, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. For their outward Enjoyments ſhould be with Perſecutions, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much the Croſs and Reproach of Chriſt (as in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Moſes</hi>) is to be preferred before the greateſt worldly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moluments.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He ſhews them, though he abundantly Rewards his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet they ought not to ſerve him as ſuch that were led by that Principle, to ſerve for Life and Glory as for Wages; but they muſt do all for his own Name ſake; they muſt not act from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of intending advantage, but for Chriſt's ſake, for the Love of his Perſon, and for the ſake of the Love that he hath ſhewed us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. The Lord knows how vain the Thoughts of his beſt People is apt to be, as if they muſt by their Duties Earn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God; but there muſt be no glorying in Men, and there's
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56391:181"/> no need of it, for all things are yours already, the Means of Grace, the World, Life, Death, <hi>things preſent, and to come, ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt God's.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. You talk abſurdly of God's Decree overthrowing his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as if the Decree ſucceeded God's Government of the Creature; that which overthrows a thing comes after the thing overthrown; ſo God's Decree in its proper Nature, as a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Immanent Act, muſt ſucceed his Government.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Why ſhould not God's Acting in a way of Free Grace be conſiſtent with his moſt right and juſt way of proceeding in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſeeing the whole Goſpel Revelation aſſerts that it is ſo, and that therein lyes a great part of the Goſpel Myſtery, which Natural Men and Carnal Reaſon will not receive.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Is it any way abſurd to ſay it's vain to propoſe our own gain by Labour and Duties, when the Spirit of God hath expunged the Efficacy of Works as to procurement, out of the Covenant of Grace; Works are our Price and Money. God ſaith, We are to buy without Price and Money, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. And ſaith, <hi>Why do you ſpend Money for that which is not Bread; i. e.</hi> Spend your Duties and Labours, and get nothing by them? Becauſe you make Money of them, and reckon you make advantage of them, and pay a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration for the good expected, and will not receive it as of Free Gift; you will have all for the Money of your Duties; and hence you labour, and have not that which ſatisfieth; you ask and labour for things to ſpend upon your own Luſts, as the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> did.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You miſtake in judging the Offers of the Goſpel is in a way of Government, it's in order to Chriſt's gracious Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which Unregenerate Sinners are not, till through Grace they are tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. You wickedly ſuggeſt, that unleſs God intend that poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their Unregenerate Eſtate ſhould do ſome Duties whereby they might gain Life and Salvation; God is chargeable with Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56391:182"/> and Falſhood; this I take to be an ill Inference, all the Offers of Grace muſt be upon Condition of Works, or elſe God is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Weakneſs and Falſhood.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. You groſly miſtake my Diſcourſe, or willingly pervert my Sence and Meaning; I do not ſay but poor Sinners at their firſt believing are very apt to lay too great a ſtreſs upon their Duties, as if thereby they obtained a Title to Life and Salvation, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="7">7. But to let paſs your perverting my Sence, you will have me to intend Works anſwering the Call of God to the Unregenerate; and you ſay to this purpoſe they muſt be encouraged by Rewards of their Works: Were it not rather to charge God as you ſay; when he ſhall offer them upon the account of their Duties, when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God tells us, they can perform none, being Spiritually dead; and that which they ſuppoſe they do cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. therefore cannot obtain any thing from him. You ſay, muſt they not ſtrive to Believe and Repent with an Eye to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and Eſcaping of Wrath?

I ſay, <hi>Who art thou, O Man, that replieſt againſt God?</hi> You come now to prove your Charge of God for Weakneſs and Folly. But if the Non-elect be in as bad a Caſe as Devils, is God guilty of Weakneſs and Falſhood? A wiſer Man than you did not think ſo, when he ſaid, <hi>God made all things for himſelf, the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Prov. 16.4. Neither was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of your mind, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears by <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 19, 20. But let me return upon you, Will you ſay that it was unrighteous with God to leave a part of Mankind under Non-election to eternal Life and Salvation? What, will you charge God with for leaving part of the Angelick Nature under it? 2. You talk of an Offer to the Non-elect, and that Offer, you ſay, muſt be ſerious, and if it be not offered upon ſuch a Condition as they can perform. But I pray, where's any Offer of Grace in the Goſpel to the Non-elect at all, as ſuch? And ſhew me any Graces given, or Goſpel Duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Non-elect, or Benefits promiſed to the Non-elect upon their performance of Graces and Duties? It would not be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeed to call for Graces and Duties, or promiſe Life unto them, or ſaving Benefits upon Performance of the ſaid Duties after the Non-election was declared to them. Now you will not own there can be any ſerious Offer made, unleſs the Condition be equally performable by Elect and Non-elect, and both be alike in the next Capacity of Salvation, or elſe they are in the ſame caſe with the Devils. And what it they be as eventually as unlikely to believe and be ſaved as the Devils, why will you be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous to charge God? May not God have Mercy on whom he will, and harden whom he will, without giving an Account of any of his matters? And what if the Non-elect be in as bad a caſe as the Devils, is God bound to be any better to them than
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56391:183"/> the Devils. For, ſay you, God muſt offer to the Non-elect with the ſame Mind and Purpoſe of ſaving Non-elect as well as of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Elect, or elſe God is not ſerious in his Offers. I deny that Goſpel-Offers are made to Elect or Non-elect, but to Sinners as ſuch; and it's made indefinitely, that the Election might obtain, and the <hi>reſt are blinded,</hi> Rom. 11.5, 6, 7. as it was with the Elect and Non-elect <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo it is with the Elect and Non-elect of all Mankind. And ſee there what God ſaith, and that ſeriouſly: At this preſent time, ſaith God, there is a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant [of <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſaved,] but according to the Election of Grace: What will you ſay but a Remnant? How comes it to paſs that the Offer was made to them that belonged not to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? You'll ſay God was not ſerious in his Offer to them, when it was ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 3.4. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt</hi> [of the Nation of the Jews] <hi>God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities.</hi> If the Non-elect in this Nation cannot perform Works (ſay you) upon the condition of which they may have the Promiſe, God deals falſly with them: Whereas the Spirit of God gives us another Account of theſe things, why notwithſtanding this general and indefinite Offer, but a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> was ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> The Election had obtained it, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if it be by Grace, then it is no more of Works, [nor of him that willeth or runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy] otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Works.</hi> 7. <hi>What then, Iſrael hath not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he ſeeketh for,</hi> [or applying it to many Profeſſors, or others under a Goſpel-Miniſtry, ſuch and ſuch hath not obtained what they pretended to ſeek after] <hi>but the Election hath obtained it.</hi> [The Grace of God (not Works) became efficacious through the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.] And what became of the Non-elect? You'll ſay, God mockt them. No, go you on to mock God with your carnal Reaſon, and hearken to the Hallow; I will tell you, yea the Spirit tells you, the reſt, the Non-elect <hi>Jews</hi> were blinded; <gap reason="foreign">

And when you have done and ſaid all about your Serious Offers, unleſs you hold conditional Election, you muſt ſtill continue to lay, theſe foul Charges and Conſequences upon God: For whatever Offers are made, the Non-elect will neither believe or be ſaved, and in reſpect of Non-election are in the ſame Condition with the Devils.</p>
                        <p>Now ſay you, then their Caſe is worſe than Devils, theſe Offers
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56391:183"/> are made to them for no other deſign, but to increaſe their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But I will tell you, it becomes ſo to them <hi>per accidens;</hi> the deſign of offering Salvation to the World is that Sinners may believe and be ſaved, not that Elect Sinners ſhould be ſecure, or Non-elect Deſpair. But what is in God's Mind as his Reaſon in making ſo indefinite an offer and tender of Grace, whoſe is Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

                        <p>I ſuppoſe you quote your Authority the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that you think the Preface was drawn up to expiate for a Fault ſome of them had committed, and was well ſchool'd for. But I pray let us a little examine whether thoſe Gentlemen be not miſtaken, in denying that Poſition, That we are not to act for Life but from Life.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt part, I am miſtaken if they will deny, That all Goſpel-acting is <hi>from</hi> Life. In natural things Life is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to all Motion and Acting. A dead thing cannot, nor is expected to move and act: As in the natural Man, ſo in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and as he muſt have Life, ſo he muſt be alive unto God in Chriſt that acts; he muſt act from him, by vertue of him, through the Power and Influence of his Grace, through the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit, from Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and knows there's no acceptable Duties or Graces but to be acted from Life as the Fountain and Spring of them; and indeed the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> acted from Life. I pray make a thing act, if you can, that hath not Life to act from.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for acting <hi>for</hi> Life, the true meaning ought to be adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That Life ſhould be our End and Aim is not to be doubted, according to a right Underſtanding of it. Chriſt propounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Life unto poor Sinners, and ſaith, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life.</hi> And ſo he is the Life unto a Believer; <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life.</hi> Now it muſt be underſtood when we ſpeak of Working for Life, we ſpeak of a conſiderate ſedate regular Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Working. Not Acting and Working as one that is ſcared
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56391:186"/> and affrighted with the danger of Life, death lying inevitably to his Apprehenſion before him; not as ſcrambling to ſave himſelf in the Water from drowning. Now a poor Sinner awakened under the Law, and ſeeing a little Glimpſe of Goſpel-hope through Grace ſhining into his Heart, it may be beſtirs himſelf with all his might, and aſcribes much to every Duty he doth.</p>
                        <p>But we ſpeak here of what the true Spirit and Diſpoſition of a Chriſtian is, he ought to arrive at by Faith; the Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he works for Life? <hi>A.</hi> I ſay, He doth, and he doth not. 1. He makes Life his ſubordinate Aim and End. But, (1.) He that hath Chriſt by Faith, doth not work as if he had not Chriſt already: (2.) He doth not work for Life, ſo as to entitle himſelf unto Life; ſome work for this end, as if he had not Life already. He ſees by Faith that he is Chriſt's, and that all things are his, whether Life, or whether things preſent or to come. (3.) He doth not work for Life, ſo far as to think thereby to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alive, or maintain himſelf in a Covenant-ſtate, ſo as by his Works to continue his Juſtification any more than to get it at firſt. (4.) He doth not work for Life in a way of remunerative Juſtice; no, not for the continuance of Life in a way of Remuneration: For indeed herein lies only the difference between a Legal and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Spirit; If the Spirit that acted the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, (I ſpeak not of a Legal Spirit ſince the Fall) and the true Spirit of a Believer in Chriſt be compared together; for <hi>Adam</hi> then acted from Life already given; he acted not as having no Life, but act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the continuance of Life, upon the account of the working Conditions enjoyned, and expected Life by way of Remuneration, <hi>i. e.</hi> the continuation of Life. Now ſuch working for Life as this we muſt reject, and ſuch is intended, when-ever we ſay we muſt not work for Life.</p>
                        <p>It's not to be underſtood, as if the Spiritual Man had not a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified rational End in all his Actings, which we ſay is for the Glory of God in Free Grace, for Chriſt in whom his Life is; he acts from the Life that is in Chriſt, and he is carried forth to it, and in it: He is <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works, that he ſhould walk in them, looking unto Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 12. And looking upon all things as his in Chriſt, his Buſineſs is to live unto Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>To me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain,</hi> i. e. I ſhall come to a further Enjoyment of Chriſt. Theology is defined to be the Doctrine of living unto God; ſo that in living unto God, and to God in Chriſt, a Chriſtian hath all things that appertain to Life and Godlineſs, <hi>through the knowledge
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56391:186"/> of God our Saviour,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>Alpha and Omega, of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to him be Glory for ever and eaer,</hi> Rom. 11.36.</p>
                        <p>Now what need all this great ado about working for Life, ſhewing the danger of this Doctrine, that it teacheth to abandon Nature, and ſuppoſeth us to do no more than other Men, and it makes all Motives uſeleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas if Men will not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Minds, they muſt own and acknowledge the ſame things that they oppoſe, unleſs they will deny their own Reaſon. But when a Spirit of Contradiction prevails, there is nothing but Quirks, Sophiſms and Equivocations can take place with Men.</p>
                        <p>And notwithſtanding all your Noiſe and Authority, to work for Life in the true Sence, it is to act as by and under a Covenant of Works; it's to work for Life as Wages, and to gain a Right and Title thereby, and ſuch a Principle will abandon the Grace of the Goſpel: It will teach to violate all the Precepts and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Goſpel, it will elude all the Promiſes, and lay a Man under the full Rigour of the Law, and will never be any effective Motive to acceptable Duty. It is a Fault it ſelf that lies under the blackeſt Mark, and of as dangerous Conſequence as any the Goſpel cautions us againſt, and warns to take heed of ſeeking the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>That true Goſpel Diſcourſe of Worthy Mr. <hi>Vink</hi> at the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Lecture will tell you better things, on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhews, That Goſpel Grace is the beſt Motive to Holineſs. He ſaith—
<q>
                              <p>Our buſineſs is to enquire after what we propound in our Obedience. If it be to expiate for my paſt Offences, or to merit undeſerved Favours, it muſt needs be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable in the ſight of God, being the higheſt act of Pride or Preſumption that can be imagined, let our Works be what they will (though the beſt are but filthy Rags) if they be offered unto God by way of Barter or Exchange; they become moſt abominable, as if God ſtood in need of ſomething that we have— To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Iniquity, or to labour in Holineſs, in order to expreſs our Thankfulneſs unto God for his Mercies in Jeſus Chriſt, is moſt grateful and moſt forcible.</p>
                              <p>Again, Love unto God for all his Glorious Excellencies, eſpecially for his Mercy in Chriſt Jeſus, is the beſt Principle of Holineſs, and our departing from Iniquity, and this Love is begun and flows from God's Love firſt.</p>
                              <p>—He that Acts according to any of God's Commandments out of hope to Merit by them, may Act out of Love indeed, but it muſt be then Self-love, to obtain, as he vainly thinks, by his Obedience Eternal Happineſs. Our Love of God ſhould exceed Self-love as far as God himſelf exceeds, which is Infinitely. Our Love of God is a Vertue, and the Foundation of the reſt. Our Love of our ſelves, thus taken, is a Sin, a Mother Sin, the cauſe of all the reſt of our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>I will acquaint you with a little of my foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe—
<q>Let us ſee what kind of evidencing believing gives, it is not a Revealing Evidence,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 491.</note> nor an Effecting Evidence, [theſe the Word and Spirit are] but it is a <hi>Receiving Evidence;</hi> or it is an Evidence as it doth receive that Teſtimony which the Spirit holds out, applying it to the Heart; [as the Eyes receive the light, and the Ears the ſound, and if we ask a Man how do you know ſuch a thing, he will ſay, I ſaw it with my Eyes, and heard it with mine Ears:] It is an evidence, as an Officer in Court that ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own knowledge, but produceth Records, and teſtifieth the Authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Records: The Life of Evidence is materially in the Records themſelves, but the Officer is an Evidence, as he doth aſſert the Truth of ſuch Records. It is even ſo with Faith, The Spirit of the Lord makes the Records, and ſpeaks the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to the Heart: Now Faith comes in and receives what the Spirit of the Lord hath written. In brief, Faith is an Evidence as it doth take Poſſeſſion of that which the Spirit of the Lord reveals, and manifeſts, and gives to a Perſon; or as it doth enter upon the Deed of Gift that the Spirit of the Lord doth bring to the Heart. Poſſeſſion is a good Evidence in Law, [they ſay it's an eleven Points;] let a Man prove he hath Lawful Poſſeſſion, and he proves his Title good. The Spirit indeed makes the Title good, but Faith makes good the Entry and Poſſeſſion, ſo clears the Title to us, though good in it ſelf before: Faith is nothing elſe but the receiving of Chriſt, and that enters upon the Poſſeſſion of him, and thus I proceeded to apply this to our purpoſe, as he hath mentioned.</q>

                        <p>I ſuppoſe you refer to what is ſpoken by the Apoſtle <hi>John, Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. where he tells of God's Records, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi> Now our Aſſurance that this Life is mine or thine in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is the Spirits working by Faith, whereby the Soul of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sinner doth appropriate this Record or Deed of Gift to himſelf. Faith doth two things whereby it arrives at Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is a Witneſs of the Truth of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. It Atteſts the Truth of this Record and Deed of Gift, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9, 10.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p>I ſay, they are ſigns that are not ſufficiently ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in themſelves to full Aſſurance, without this that proceeds from Faith; for if you have never ſo many Signs,</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="313" facs="tcp:56391:188"/>1. They may be true, or they may not, without a Witneſs of the Spirit to it, [though you declaim ſo much againſt it;] you cannot come to an Aſſurance, but only to a probability, and you have not a certitude of Judgment, only an Opinion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If they be true, you muſt believe them to be true, or elſe you have no Aſſurance. A Man hath no Aſſurance of the Truth if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not; and then how ſhould you believe the Truth of your Signs, but by the Truth of the Word revealed and believed. The Word tells you your Obedience, Love, Sincerity, muſt be ſo and ſo; you believe the Word, but in comparing your Qualifications with the Word, and the deſcriptions given of them there, you will find them fall ſo ſhort, that unleſs the Spirit aſſure you there is the Truth of Grace in your Hearts, you will be as much at a loſs as to Aſſurance as ever.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>I propounded this Queſtion, How a Perſon may know in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular his own Intereſt in Chriſt?<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 478, 479.</note> Firſt I diſcovered the litigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dubiouſneſs of the way that many Perſons go for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and reſolving of this caſe. I Inſtanced in three marks, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience, Sincerity of Heart, and Love of the Brethren; and ſome have conceived, that in the Diſcourſe I have directly ſtruck at the Heart of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as if I did attempt the overthrow of them: But miſtake not, I ſpake only of their Inſufficiency, that they are weak through the Fleſh, to give a Satisfactory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the great caſe depending, they are of excellent uſe in their own kind, Sphere and Orb; but when they are ſet on work to do thoſe things that are beyond their power, Men do but entangle themſelves inſtead of getting themſelves looſe. I ſhewed, as to Univerſal Obedience,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 480, 481.</note> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to propriety of Speech, there is none of it in the World; and as it is practiſed to this end it leaves the caſe very doubtful; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of many Imperfections that attend, and in reſpect of the purpoſes of the Heart, which are many times extreamly corrupt, and that there is ſo much in our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence common to Unbelievers and Hypocrites. As for Sincerity, which as the Apoſtle deſcribes, is Simplicity and Singleneſs of Heart towards God, that we find the <hi>Jews</hi> that were Enemies to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, had a Zeal for God; and you know what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, what deſigns he had undoubtedly in ſingleneſs of Heart to do God Service. And beſides, I ſhew how falſe and deceitful we find our Hearts upon Self-examination.</p>
                           <p>I ſpoke alſo as to Love of the Brethren which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks ſo much of, if we underſtand how the Apoſtle deſcribes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And if a Man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Heart by theſe particulars, I know his Heart cannot but tell him he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding faulty in all theſe —</p>
                           <p>But I do not determine peremptorily, that a man cannot by way of Evidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any comfort from his Sanctification; and I will give you ſomewhat further for clearing my Judgment to you, which I know is according to Truth; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit of the Lord muſt firſt reveal the gracious Mind of God to our Spirits, and give us Faith to receive that Teſtimony of the Spirit, and to ſit down as ſatisfied with his Teſtimony, before ever any Work of Sanctification can poſſibly give any Evidence. But when the Teſtimony of the Spirit of the Lord is received by Faith, and the Soul ſits down ſatisfied with that Teſtimony of the Lord, then alſo all the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56391:189"/> Gifts of God's Spirit do bear witneſs, together with the Spirit of the Lord, and the Faith of a Believer. So that I do not deny the uſe of ſigns and marks in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation you ſee, as you ſuggeſt.</p>

                        <p>That the Spirit is a Revealing Evidence, and works immediately, as it is the Spirit or Grace in all God's Children, is not to be denied, and yet works immediately by the Word and Means of Grace too, and it works immediately ſo ordinarily; I do not mean that it works immediately by way of extraordinary Revelation and Inſpiration when it works in this kind. But its way of ordinary working is mediately by the Word, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the Word.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>I put <hi>this Queſtion,</hi> Is there any Evidences in the World by which Perſons may comfortably claim their Intereſt in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 465.</note> 
                              <hi>A.</hi> Yes, there are two. 1. The Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evidence. 2. The Receiving Evidence.

                           <p>To clear up this, I ſay, the Spirit of the Lord is mainly ſent into the World by Chriſt for this very purpoſe, to ſpeak perſonally and particularly to the Hearts of Men, to ſatisfie them of their Intereſt in Chriſt.

That it is true the Spirit of the Lord never ſpeaks to the Heart of any Believer, but he always applies according to the Word of Grace Revealed, and the Voice of the Spirit, and if the Word of Grace be in the Soul, (as they go always together in the Faithful,) they will agree as Face anſwers Face in a Glaſs; but yet beware that you make not the Credit of the Voice of the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Word barely conſidered —</p>
                           <p>In brief therefore, as it is the Teſtimony of God's Spirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed according to the Word,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 475.</note> that muſt ſatisfie us that we are the Children of God; ſo it muſt be the ſame Spirit muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that he is the true Spirit of God, and not of Deluſion. But ſtill I ſay, this Spirit of the Lord ſpeaks always to Perſons concerning their Intereſt in Chriſt, according to the Word of Grace; and it is moſt certainly true, that every Voice in Man ſpeaking peace, being contrary to the Word of Grace, that Voice is not the Voice of the Spirit of the Lord, yet it is only the Spirit of the Lord can ſatisfie the Spirit of a Man in this thing, that it is his own Teſtimony, and not a Spirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion:</p>
                           <p>You may underſtand the Word in a double ſence, either for the Word of the Law, or elſe for the Word of Grace in the Goſpel. Now mark, when we ſay it is the Spirit of God bearing witneſs with our Spirits, according to the Word, that we are the Sons of God; it's not the Word of the Law that agrees in this with the Voice of the Spirit; the Word of the Law ſpeaks nothing but Curſes.</p>
                           <p>—The Word in which the Spirit of the Lord ſpeaks to his People, is the Word of Grace, and the Word of Grace is no more but this, [as to the Sum and Subſtance of it, in this, or ſuch like Expreſſion thereof.] <hi>God was in Chriſt Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himſelf, not Imputing their Treſpaſſes.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Truth; The ordinary way whereby a Man attaineth a well-grounded aſſurance, is not by immediate objective Revelation, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Voice, ſaying,</hi> Thy Sins are forgiven. <hi>D. W.</hi> p. 160.</p>

                        <p>I judge by this Negation you ſet by theſe things from Aſſurance, as having nothing to do ordinarily in it. 1. That no Voice is heard any way by the Soul, <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven,</hi> that is not to be believed by a direct Act of Faith. 2. That Forgiveneſs
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56391:190"/> of Sin is not revealed to a Believer by the Word of Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. 3. That the Spirit of God hath nothing to do in bringing the Soul to appropriate and apply the general Promiſe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own Soul. So that here, as to our believing Forgiveneſs of Sin, neither the Spirit, nor the Objective Revelation of the Goſpel, nor indeed Faith it ſelf in it's receiving Nature, hath any thing to do, but only as a Sign and Mark ſet upon the Soul.</p>

                           <hi>But when a Believer is examining his Heaert and Life by the Word, the Holy Spirit enlightens the mind there to diſcern Faith and Love, and ſuch other Qualifications, which the Goſpel declareth to be the infallible Signs of Regeneration: And he adds ſuch Power to the Teſtimony of Conſcience for the Truth and In-being of theſe Graces, as begets in a Soul a joyful ſenſe of it's comfortable ſtate, and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Freedom from thoſe Fears which accompany a doubting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: And according to the Evidence of theſe Graces, Aſſurance is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſtrong or weak.</hi>

                        <p>I obſerve now, though you would let the Spirit have no hand in the Evidence of Faith, yet you need its help to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten about Signs and Qualifications. I pray, how doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enlighten here? Is it by any objective Revelation, or by any inward Dictate or Intimation? And cannot the Spirit as well enlighten the Mind to behold Chriſt in the Promiſe by an Act of Faith, as to behold Faith and Love in our ſelves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You will not admit the Declaration of the Goſpel received and embraced by Faith to evidence, but that it ſeems the Heart and Life muſt be examined by the Word as a Rule: So that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance muſt be wrought by the Word as a Law, not as a Goſpel, ſo far as you are come up to a Conformity to the Rule, not a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of your Intereſt in the Grace of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You had need have the Light of the Spirit to find an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sign in you too, though they be declared in the Goſpel. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> pretend to them, and you cannot tell whether you are any better than a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> without an infallible Voice of the Spirit, (according to your Doctrine;) for you muſt know that you ſhall perſevere in thoſe Qualifications, and it's impoſſible for a Man to be aſſured till Death, or can be aſſured of his Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance till then, (all other Signs will ſignifie nothing) without an Infallible Witneſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You muſt have a Power added by the Spirit to the Teſtimony of Conſcience, that it may witneſs the Truth and In-being of Graces. What's the Reaſon it cannot witneſs the Truth of our In-being in Chriſt, and add a Power to our Faith to believe even unto Aſſurance?</p>

All this Examination, Illumination of the Spirit, Goſpel-Declaration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may at laſt beget a joyful Senſe or a reconciled State, you ſay; but according to you it cannot be Aſſurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot yet try by Perſeverance; the Soul is in a little hopes it's in a probable way to Salvation, but cannot be aſſured he is in a ſure ſtate, or ſhall certainly be ſaved, becauſe he muſt continue his Juſtified State by his Works; and therefore it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to try and find ſo far as to Aſſurance; becauſe he hath not perſevered, you'l ſay, it may be: He muſt believe his Perſeverance, and be aſſured of it by Faith; then, I ſay, there's as much ground to believe and be aſſured by Faith of all our Salvation.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. You ſpeak not of an Aſſurance in all you have ſaid, but of ſome comfortable Freedom from Doubtings, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Grounds: This amounts to more than Opinion at laſt, the only Judgment of a contingent Axiom; and you tell us elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where our State here is but of Tryal not decided, therefore there can be no Aſſurance at all in this Life.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. You do well to add at laſt, that according to the Evidence of theſe Graces, Aſſurance is ordinarily ſtrong or weak: And may not that Aſſurance be ſo, which we call the Aſſurance of Faith?

                        <p>This is one way, but not the only or principal way: The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells often, that Love, if it be true, and from a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56391:193"/> true Principle, and Root, is an Argument of our Regenerate ſtate, but that it may be known to be ſuch, it muſt be traced to the Head, (it being but a ſtream) to ſee how it flows from the Love of Chriſt apprehended by Faith, whereby we have our Radical hold and ſtanding. And as he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Hereby we know we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> Yet leſt he ſhould leave us in the dark, and we ſhould take falſe Love for true, he tells us, there is another Judgment to paſs upon our Love before we can argue from it, we muſt find that it flows from our percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Love of God, in laying down his Life for us; and from thence ſhould proceed our readineſs to lay down our Life for the Brethren; <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>In this we know, or are aſſured of God's Love, in that he laid down his Life for us.</hi> The Love of God believed gives the Original Ground of Aſſurance, and is the greateſt, and the Touchſtone to an other. A Witneſs from Men, from what is found in us, is ſomething, but the Witneſs of God is greater, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9. And the witneſs that he hath given to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel concerning his Son teſtified by the Spirit, and applyed by Faith, is that Evidence upon which all firm Aſſurance is Radically Built. And you ſhall plainly ſee, that <hi>John</hi> doth not found our Aſſurance Radically upon Love, but in Juſtifying Faith; he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Let us be ſincere in Love;</hi> and I will tell you whereby you ſhall attain to good Aſſurance; <hi>ver.</hi> 19 <gap reason="foreign">

It's true it was, and the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience as to our Hearts and Ways is matter of Rejoicing, but this was in <hi>Paul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confidence in the Fleſh, or aſcribing any thing to it, but by ſeeing all in Chriſt, and that all flowed down from the Free Grace and Love of God, all his Simplicity and Sincerity of Heart was ſeen by Faith to be Gifts of Grace; therefore you ſee whenſoever the Children of God took any Comforts and Rejoicings from the Fruits of the Spirit, they made not theſe as the Fundamental ground of their Aſſurance, but a confirming and additional ground, and ſuch as was very uncertain, inſomuch that at ſome times they were at a perfect loſs for them, yet was not without their rooted and

                        <p>What is this Argument brought for, is this to prove that there's no Aſſurance by the Voice of the Spirit? And that the only way of Aſſurance is by Signs and Marks? But you have brought in this place of Scripture as many Men retain Councel in their Caſe, they Fee ſome Councel only that they may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but the Word of God will not be Bribed, this place is directly againſt you. The Apoſtle here tells us the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Office of the Holy Ghoſt, that it becomes a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, this is the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. And what is it that it doth? it teacheth us to call God Father; and how doth it do this? <hi>A.</hi> It's by witneſſing to us our Relation, <hi>viz. that we are the Sons of God;</hi> this is that which doth aſſure us of our Inheritance: <hi>if Children then Heirs.</hi>

I deny it, for that which cauſeth our Spirits to give Evidence, is not the younger Evidence, but the Spirit cauſeth our Hearts to give Evidence, <hi>Ergo:</hi> Now for the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the Spirit cauſeth our Hearts to give Evidence, I prove from your ſelf; you ſay the Spirit concurrs with our Spirit as its Inſtrument; now the Efficient is before the Inſtrument by which it works, and <hi>Inſtrumentum</hi> is but <hi>Cauſa Miniſtrans</hi> at moſt, and is <hi>res motu facta,</hi> in that reſpect is <hi>effectum efficientis.</hi> Now the way of the Spirits witneſſing is by bringing to our Spirit an objective Manifeſtation of Grace in the Promiſe, and cauſing us by Faith to make a particular application thereof to our ſelves, and ſo we become by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit to be the Children of God by Faith, in the ſame ſence we are <hi>Heirs according to the Promiſe, Gal.</hi> 3.29. Now therefore the Spirit muſt witneſs firſt as the Worker of this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the Promiſe, that Faith may witneſs; and you your ſelf ſaid but now, that the Spirit witneſſeth as a Worker of Grace, therefore as the Worker of the Grace of Aſſurance.

                        <p>I marvel a Divine ſhould ſpeak at ſuch a rate; as if an Evidence of Pardon were not an Evidence of Grace: Is not Pardon the higheſt degree of Grace? is not the Word of Grace therefore ſo, becauſe it is a Word of Pardon to Sinners? And if you mean Inherent Grace, why may not the Spirit give evidence of Pardon to a Sinners evidence of it in an act of Believing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be any Fruits of Faith? Was it not ſo with the Thief upon the Croſs, and many that God pardons juſt upon the laſt moment of their Lives? And is it not ſo with many of Gods Children that can ſee no Evidences in themſelves? the Spirit ſtrips them of all grounds in themſelves, and that gives a full ſatisfaction in objective Grace, with the full Aſſurance of Faith, that the Creature may be laid low, and Chriſt may be glorified. I muſt tell you, that a meer Sinner is the Object of Pardon, and not a Sinner conſidered under any holy Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>The whole need not the Phyſician:</hi> Chriſt finds and pardons loſt Sinners, and there's no Sinner applies pardon aright but as a meer Sinner, tho he hath Faith: But of this I have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our Eighth Conference, and Twelfth.</p>

                        <p>I will give you my full ſence of the Doctrine of Aſſurance. The certainty of a Thing or Propoſition can be founded but upon one of theſe two Bottoms, either upon an Artificial or Inartificial Argument (ſo called in Logick:) An Argument artificial gives me ſenſible or rational ground for what I am aſſured of, and it argues Things from Cauſes, Effects, Subjects, Adjuncts, Diſſentaneities, wherein are <hi>diverſa &amp; oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita,</hi> &amp;c. But an inartificial Argument is founded on Teſtimony, and according to the faithfulneſs of him that brings it, it gives more or leſs ground of belief: This is reckoned in Logick the weakeſt ground of Knowledge, eſpecially being <hi>Teſtimonium hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum</hi> that is brought; it may be a probable ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but is not an Infallible one, and therefore the Judgment upon it uſually goes no further than Opinion, that which is of a Contingency. But in Theology, <hi>Teſtimonium Divinum,</hi> Divine Teſtimony is the greateſt ground of Certainty and Aſſurance in the World; becauſe he that ſpeaks is unchangeably true, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, juſt and holy, he cannot ly: Now hence it is, that what Teſtimony comes from God himſelf, it is to be believed, becauſe it is ſo without reaſoning any further, and is the greateſt ground of Aſſurance in the World; therefore I affirm, that the Witneſs of God in his Word, and the Spirit in the Heart, firmly believed, is, and produceth the greateſt Aſſurance for firmneſs and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the World.</p>
                        <p>This is that which ought to ly in the bottom of all our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this will hold above all in the hour of Temptation, when all Signs and Marks ſail; tho our Faith may be ſometimes ſhaken, and our Comforts and Aſſurances eclips'd, ſo that our Faith may
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56391:200"/> hold but as far as a Hoping or Perſwaſion of a Probability of our State and Condition; yet, as Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſaith, as the Evidence is ſtrong or weak, ſo our Aſſurance is ſtrong or weak. Now that Faith ſtill carries with it a Hypoſtaſis or Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing believed, grounded upon the Certainty, Truth and Infallibility of God, I am fully ſatisfied from that Portion of Scripture that evinces it undeniably, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
                        <p>And as now for other grounds of Comfort and Aſſurance which ariſe from the Viſibility of the Grace of God, and the Fruits of the Spirit in the Heart and Life, I highly value them, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate grounds of Comfort and Confirmation in Aſſurance, theſe are ſeen by the reflection of the Soul upon it ſelf, being able in regenerate man to reaſon in a ſpiritual manner from Cauſes, Effects, Subjects and Adjuncts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he finds in himſelf, according to the Rule of the Word of God: This I call Experimental Aſſurance; and this is that which is ſo long attaining to, and when it is had, may be loſt again in a great meaſure, as Comfort therefore. And becauſe many Believers take this to be all the Aſſurance they muſt look for, and their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers tell them ſo, therefore they go mourning all their dayes, and are only ſupported by what degrees of Aſſurance is in their Faith, which they take not to be any; and their Teachers tell them that Faith hath nothing of Aſſurance in it, but, do ſuggeſt as if it were but the roving of the Mind in uncertainties and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and that it is Preſumption for them to believe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Aſſurance, though the Spirit of God doth command and encourage it again and again, and that doubting is rather their Vertue than Sin; whereas ſo much as there is of Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled with their Faith, ſo much there is of Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                        <p>In true Faith there is the Promiſe more or leſs believed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Truth and Goodneſs (becauſe a Promiſe reached forth a Truth which carries Goodneſs in it to us-ward) is received; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>So that they make three grounds of Aſſurance: 1. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Aſſurance of Faith. 2. The inward Evidences of Graces. 3. The Witneſs of the Spirit of Adoption.</p>

                           <q>There are three great Graces ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Faith, Hope, Love:</hi>

                        <p>
                           <q>Firſt, The <hi>Aſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true Heart, in full aſſurance of Faith.</hi> This Aſſurance of Faith hath a double reſpect: 1. To our Perſons: 2. To our Services, that in both we are pleaſing to God.</q>

                           <q>Secondly, There's an <hi>Aſſurance of Hope,</hi> Heb. 6.11. Faith hath an Eye to the Truth of the Promiſe, Hope to the Good of the Promiſe; and the Aſſurance of Hope is that we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly receive that Good.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>Thirdly, There's an Aſſurance of <hi>Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.48. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love caſts out Fear.</hi> How is Love made Perfect, and how doth it caſt out Fear? <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is love made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in the World: i. e.</hi> As his Love is ſincere to us, ſo is ours to him (according to our meaſure) even in this life, and this gives us boldneſs, our Aſſurance that all ſhall go well with us in the day of Judgment; ſo this Love caſteth out all fear of Condemnation in that day, which Fear where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains hath Torment, than which nothing is more contrary to Aſſurance. In perfect Love there is no Torment, becauſe there is no Fear; and there is no Fear, becauſe there is an Aſſurance of the Love of God, in this love the Soul doth repoſe, reſt and delight it ſelf. There is a Fourth thing ſpoken of, which is <hi>a full aſſurance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> This is Clearneſs of our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion about the things which we do believe, and upon which we faſten by Faith and Love: The Light of the Underſtanding ſhining upon the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and mixing with our other Graces, bottoms the Soul upon the ſtrongeſt Foundation, and raiſeth it up to the higheſt Pinnacle of Aſſurance.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>We may ſay of Aſſurance in reference to theſe four Graces, as Philoſophers do of the Heavens, in reference to the four Elements, That they are neither of the four Elements, but a Quinteſſence of a fiſth Eſſence: So we may ſay of Aſſurance, it is neither Faith nor Hope, nor Love, nor Knowledge, but it is a fifth thing, ſublimated and raiſed, either out of, or above all thoſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> when Aſſurance is raiſed to the higheſt pitch, that it is a <hi>full Aſſurance,</hi> from whence our <hi>Joy is full;</hi> all a Chriſtians Sails are filled, being under a full gale, and having fair weather.</q>

                        <p>I have vindicated my ſelf already, as to thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in our Debate concerning God's laying Sin on Chriſt; but, leſt you ſhould have forgot what was ſaid, I ſhall ſpeak a little to it.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>My deſign hath been in ſeveral Diſcourſes, and in that mentioned by you, that we muſt have Chriſt before we can be holy, as the Root of all gracious Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that Chriſt is beſtowed in a way of efficacy before we have him in a way of evidence; and God tells us whoſe Iniquities were laid on Chriſt, even of them that were gone every one away as loſt Sheep, and turned to their own ways; the ſame thing that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God recommended his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in that while we were yet ſinners</hi> [it muſt be meant unbeiieving and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners] <hi>Christ died for us;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son;</hi> that muſt be underſtood of our being in a ſtate of enmity, before we come to a ſtate of Grace, this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wrought by Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhall give you my Diſcourſe as briefly as I may, that you may ſee my meaning.</p>
                           <p>— Faith you know is the firſt of all Gifts God beſtows upon a Soul,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 334.</note> and all other Graces they follow that Faith that Chriſt doth give to Men. So that if there be not a Believing, there can be no Grace of Sanctification at all, but while perſons are departing from the living God, there remains in them an evil Heart of unbelieving; and yet this is true, that while they are departing from the living God, and ſtraying as loſt Sheep, their Iniquities are laid on Chriſt, and the true meaning of the word <hi>[turn to our own ways]</hi> is, that Men do what they liſt, and what is good in their own eyes; and yet it is the Iniquity of theſe Men, that have thus turned to their own ways, which the Lord hath laid upon Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>From whence I lay down this Concluſion:</p>
                           <p>That this Grace of the Lords laying Iniquity on Chriſt, is certainly applied unto perſons, even while they are departing from the living God, while they are loſt Sheep, while they are turned every one to their own way, before they have amended their ways. And becauſe this Truth is ſo hardly received, ſeeming to give ſo much way to looſneſs, as ſome calumniate, I endeavour to clear it,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 435.</note> and that it is a moſt fearful Injury unto a Man's ſelf, and a forſaking a Man's own Mercy, directly for a Man to conclude, that there is no Grace for me, becauſe I cannot find ſuch and ſuch things in me, as Univerſal Obedience, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you ſhall plainly ſee where Grace is applied unto Perſons, and to what Condition of Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.</p>
                           <p>And then I open that where God is ſaid to give his Gifts to the Rebellious, and uſe the ſaid Expreſſions which he rehearſeth, which amounts only to thus much in my ſenſe, that when the Grace of Redemption and the application thereof is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56391:203"/> firſt applied, it finds us loſt Creatures, loſt Sheep, rebellious ones, turning every one to his own ways; which I alſo illuſtrate from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9.</p>
                           <p>— What Qualifications can you find in blind-eyed and ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Perſons, that are bound up under the Bondage of Satan,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 439.</note> even dead in Treſpaſſes? What renewed Qualifications in Sanctification can you find in ſuch Perſons, ſeeing the firſt Work that God works upon any Perſon, is to open the eyes to ſee him, and to ſee themſelves. Now Chriſt muſt be preſent, becauſe he is given to do this thing before it can be done: — If it be the Eye of Faith, Chriſt is ſaid to be the Author and Finiſher of it; if it be the the Eye of God, we muſt all be taught of God; our Saviour ſpeaks plainly, when he pointed out directly to the Jews, for whom he died and became ſin, <hi>I came to ſave that which was loſt;</hi> it's by the Eye of Knowledge, we muſt be taught all of God. And this is one part of God's Covenant, <hi>I will remember their Sins no more.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>— What is that Covenant? <hi>I will be their God, and thy ſhall be my People; and your Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 438.</note> This is the ſubſtance of the Covenant, And Chriſt himſelf is given over to Men; as much as to ſay, In Chriſt I will become thy God; In Chriſt I will remember thy Sins and Iniquities no more: This is the ſubſtance of the Covenant; Chriſt is this Covenant, and Chriſt himſelf is given over to Men; <hi>quaſi dicat, In Chriſt I will become thy God; In Chriſt I will remember thy Sins and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities no more; this have I given in him to you:</hi> But when doth the Lord paſs over this to perſons? When they are firſt renewed. Have perſons the knowledge of God and of themſelves before the Lord makes this Deed of Gift over to them? <hi>Mark what follows,</hi> You ſhall ſee all the Qualifications of Sanctification muſt not only follow Chriſt given, but they are the very work of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after he is given; <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant to open blind eyes.</hi> Now altho' the end of things be firſt in the Intention, yet it is the laſt in Execution: If a Workman be to build an Houſe, the Work muſt be prepared before the Houſe can be builded by him.</p>

                        <p>I think, Mr. <hi>Antinomian,</hi> you have ſaid enough to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate yourſelf from his firſt Charge, I doubt not but that our Sins were all at once laid on Chriſt; <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sins were on Chriſt in the heighth of his Rebellion and Perſecution, and Chriſt came upon him effectually to convert him, as the Fruit thereof, even in the midſt of his Rebellion. He ſaith the grace of laying ſin on Chriſt, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſinners while they are departed from God, and is the cauſe of the gift of Converting-grace; plain Inſtances whereof were <hi>Saul</hi> and the Jaylor, whom the Covenant-grace took hold on in the heighth of their Rebellion. But all this reacheth not the Proof of your Charge, which you call Error here.</p>

Things that are not ſeen, they are hidden and ſecret and ſhall not be known; I mean the things of God's love to men ſhall not be known to particular men till they do believe. But conſidering their real condition <hi>[in foro Dei]</hi> the Lord hath not one ſin to charge an elect perſon with; from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life, till the laſt minute of it, there is not ſo much as original ſin, the ground is, the Lord hath ſaid it on Chriſt already. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.14. Was there by one act the expiation of ſin and all at once that were committed from the beginning of the World to the end thereof, how comes it to paſs, that this or that ſin ſhould be laid upon elect perſons, when they were laid upon Chriſt long before?</q>
                        <p>I deny not, but, according to the ſenſe of the Law, and <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> they are charged, and ſin is laid to their charge; but I ſpeak of their real ſtanding in the Eye of God's Juſtice, their ſins were laid on Chriſt, and carried away by him.</p>

I anſwer, with the Apoſtle, <hi>Do we herein make void the Law?</hi> God forbid; the rather, we eſtabliſh the Law. May not a perſon come and acknowledge his Fault to his Prince, after he hath received his Pardon under the Hand of his Prince, when he is brought from the Place of Execution? Nay, may he not acknowledge it with melting and extream bitterneſs of Spirit, becauſe he knoweth he hath a Pardon? It is but a ſordid and groſs Conceipt in the Heart of Perſons to think, that there can be no Humiliation for Sin except Perſons be in deſpair. I ſay, when Chriſt doth reveal himſelf to your Spirits, you ſhall find your Hearts more wrought upon with ſweet Meltings and Relentings of Heart, and Breathings of Spirit, when you ſee your Sins pardoned, than in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Condition you can be in. Many Malefactors have been obſerved to be hard hearted, that they could not ſhed a Tear at the Place of Execution, yet when they have heard their Pardon read, have melted into a Flood of Tears: And ſo, I ſay, that Heart that could not relent to ſee the filthy loathſomneſs of Sin, before he ſaw his Pardon, after the knowledge of it, doth melt into Tears, and hath ſuch relenting, that none in the World hath, but he that knoweth it: I ſay, the Grace of God doth teach Men more Duty than any thing elſe in the World, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13.

                        <p>You here grant, 1. That a Believer, upon falling into relapſes or ſin, is not bound to disbelieve the pardon of former ſins. 2. The reaſon is, That God doth not judicially charge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins already pardoned; and if ſo, he is bound to believe God doth not. And hath he ground to believe God will not charge ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially ſins formerly pardoned? hath he not then abundant ground to believe, and the ſame ground to believe God will pardon this ſin alſo? and is there a foundation in the Goſpel to believe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſome ſins, and not of all? 3.

The Lord ſo far chargeth the beſt of his People as to reprove them for ſin; this is an Act of Grace in order to recover them. 3. Sin is ſin in its true nature ſtill; Chriſt died not to ſave ſin, but the ſinner, that ſin ſhould not be judicially charged on him: You ſay, God doth not judicially charge a Chriſtian with ſome ſins, tho' he may preſent them to his view for his humbling; if God ſhould ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially charge any ſin, there muſt be a new ſacrifice of atonement before it could be forgiven: when the Apoſtle ſaith, who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect; there's no doubt but there's

                        <p>And as to our Saviour's Teaching his Diſciples to pray for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don daily, it's eaſily anſwered, That Pardon of Sin in Scripture-ſenſe, is to be underſtood of God's manifeſting Pardon and Forgiveneſs to juſtified ones; its of the Grace that we receive in Chriſt from day to day, it's the lifting up of the Light of God's Countenance upon us, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining with healing in his Wings or Rays of Grace: How many other Benefits that a Believer hath in Chriſt, doth he daily pray for? As for the Spirit of Adoption, Sanctification in Chriſt Jeſus, who is as ſurely made to us Sanctification as Juſtification: All the Bleſſings that we have in Chriſt, we pray for; and its needful that we have them in Chriſt, or elſe we can't pray in Faith for them.

And they ſay, in Anſwer to that Queſtion,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Larger Catech.</hi> Q. 70.</note> What is Juſtification? <hi>A.</hi> Juſtification is an Act of God's free Grace unto ſinners, in which he pardoneth all their ſins [therefore them that ſhall be committed, as well as thoſe that are committed already] accepteth their perſons righteous in his ſight, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, [therefore not for their act of Faith, or their ſincere Obedience] but only for the perfect Obedience and full Satisfaction of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>Therefore he never forgives for the Humiliations or Sorrow for Sin, which they exert; and whereas they ſay God doth continue to forgive, it's as much as to ſay, God continues them juſtified from all their Sins; which Juſtification falls in by way of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to their Souls and Conſciences, in manifeſtation of pardon, as their ſins are committed; and in ſaying, that they never fall from their juſtified eſtate, they do as much as ſay, that there is not a moment of time wherein their perſons are not juſtified before God; and to ſay any man is in a juſtified eſtate, and not in a pardoned eſtate at the ſame time, is a contradiction and nonſenſe; it's one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56391:212"/> thing to be pardoned and free of condemnation in reſpect of a Man's perſon, and another thing not to have the ſenſe and comfort of it: and after this manner only any ſin of a Believer is unpardoned, when his heart is overwhelmed with darkneſs and unbelief from the deceitfulneſs of ſin; beſides, God hides his face and the light of his countenance from him in fatherly diſpleaſure, [<hi>i. e.</hi> in tender love, it is called diſpleaſure, but by a Catechreſis, a Father corrects his Son in great love] and <hi>Believers</hi> may not have the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance reſtored unto them [they ſay not their juſtification reſtored] until they humble themſelves and confeſs their ſins [in faith, for without faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Chriſt apprehended by faith, their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and confeſſions cannot pleaſe God] and renew their faith and repentance. And they ſay, The juſtification of Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, was in all thoſe reſpects one and the ſame with the juſtification of Believers under the New.</p>
                        <p>As for your quoting Authority for Praying for Pardon, I think you might have ſpared yourſelf the pains, if you underſtand Pardon in this caſe as it ought to be underſtood.</p>

                        <p>The Scripture is moſt expreſs in this Point, that God ſees no ſin in juſtified ones, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as to ſet their perſons in the eye of his Juſtice, and to deal with them as ſuch who are under his vindicative Wrath.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, he is a bleſſed Man whoſe Iniquity is forgiven, whoſe Sin is covered, and to whom the Lord imputes not Iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. What can be meant by covering here, but hiding our ſins from the eye of God's Juſtice by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in the ſame ſenſe as <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins?</hi> There's the Face of God in his Juſtice, as well as in his Mercy; nay, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the Wrath of God, againſt Perſons or People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8. he calls it, ſetting their Iniquities before him, and their ſecret Sins in the light of his Countenance, of ſuch as are conſumed by God's Anger, and God's Wrath troubleth them.</p>
                        <p>What is the meaning of that famous place, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18, 19, 20. is it not, that God ſeeth no ſin in juſtified ones, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Who is a God, like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56391:213"/> heritage?</hi> He retaineth not his Anger for every, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy.</p>
                        <p>Now, when he hath pardoned Iniquity, will he charge it again? No, he will caſt all the Sins [of juſtified ones, ſuch as he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned] into the depths of the Sea.</p>
                        <p>How ſhall their Sins then be found any more in the deep fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean? They ſhall not be found: <hi>The iniquity of Iſrael [i. e.</hi> the true ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael] ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found, for I will pardon whom I reſerve,</hi> Jer. 50.20. And thoſe days are there ſpoken of when the clear diſcovery of Grace of the New Covenant ſhall be made, which the ſame Prophet foretells, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32, 33. and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> quotes, <hi>ch.</hi> 8.12. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.17. <hi>I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and for their ſins and iniquities I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them no more.</hi> And what means that of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38.17. <hi>For peace I had great bitterneſs,</hi> [in reſpect of Temptations, Darkneſs and Afflictions] but what was his comfort and ſupport, <hi>thou hast in love to my ſoul delivered it from the pit of corruption,</hi> [God had added ſome Years to his life] <hi>for thou hast caſt all my ſins behind thy back.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And what was the great intention of the living Sacrifice of the Scape-goat, in the day of attonement, and after the High-Prieſts charging all the Sins of the Congregation ſolemnly upon him? He was ſent into the Land of Forgetfulneſs, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. Was it not to point out God's non-remembrance of the ſins of juſtified ones? that as Chriſt died and anſwered the Type of the Slain goat, in ſatisfying for ſin, ſo he carried away the remembrance of our ſins from before the Lord; he was delivered for our Offences, and roſe for our Juſtification; and the Apoſtle lays the ſtreſs of carrying away of ſin upon his Reſurrection and Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, 35. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. He was manifeſted to take away ſin, to carry it quite away from before God, into forgetfulneſs, as the true Scape-goat.</p>
                        <p>Neither will we part with that famous Portion of Scripture, as an unmoveable bottom for this Truth, if there were no more, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the falſe gloſſes that have been put upon it by ſuch as would curſe where God will bleſs, I mean <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He hath not beheld Iniquity in Jacob, nor ſeen Perverſeneſs in Iſrael.</hi> Which is plainly to be underſtood of Spiritual <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the Old and New Teſtament; ſuch God hath commanded to bleſs, and they ſhall not be curſed, but bleſſed; there is the ſhout of a King amongſt them: Therefore as there is no Enchantment or Divination,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56391:213"/> ſo no new-coin'd Divinity can be againſt them, to bring them under God's Wrath and Curſe. I add what follows:</p>
                        <p>Becauſe I hear a certain Miniſter in Town hath lately charged this publickly as an Error, to ſay, <hi>God ſees no Sin in his People;</hi> he ſhould have firſt charged the Scripture with Error, and refuted it; and then he ſhould have charged that Divine with Error, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in continuation of Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations: See what he ſaith on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>No condemnation, or no one condemnation; he doth not ſay, there is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of condemnation, or nothing damnable in them that are in Chriſt, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and enough of that; but he ſaith, there is no actual condemnation: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. and 5.24. There is a <hi>Meioſis</hi> in the words, more is underſtood than expreſt; he means, that Juſtification and Eternal Salvation is the Portion of ſuch; the poſitive is included in the negative; it's God's condemnation only, from which ſuch as are in Chriſt are exempted; they are nevertheleſs condemned and cenſured by Men, and ſometimes by their own Conſciences.</p>
                           <p>And on <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</hi> &amp;c. Who can implead ſuch, or put in an accuſation againſt them? There is nothing to accuſe them of, they are juſtified.</p>
                           <p>And there is none to Accuſe them, it is God that hath Juſtified them; the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge hath Abſolved them: This ſeems to be taken out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.8, 9. they were Chriſt's words there, and ſpoken of God's juſtifying him; and they are every Believer's words here, intended of God's juſtifying them; and ſeems to be from two reaſons; one implied, <hi>i. e.</hi> God's electing them, the other expreſs'd God's juſtifying and acquitting them.</p>
                           <p>And on <hi>Ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died,</hi> &amp;c. His Death frees them from condemnation; thereby he hath made a ſufficient attonement and ſatisfaction for all their ſins; and which hath long ago ſatisfied in Heaven for the ſins of all the Elect, may very well ſerve to ſatisfie the Heart and Conſcience of a believing ſinner here on Earth; ſuch an one may throw down the Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as the Apoſtle doth, and challenge all the World; let Conſcience, Carnal Reaſon, Law, Sin, Hell, and Devils, let them all bring forth what they can, it will not be ſufficient for condemnation, and that becauſe of Chriſt's Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                           <p>Dr. <hi>Jacomb,</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. ſaith, we read it [no condemnation] the Original will bear it, if we read it [not one condemnation] <gap reason="foreign">

Tho' naturally Sin hath a Sting, yet there is a Victory over this Sting, Chriſt is the death of it, and he took away the Sting of it.

                        <p n="1">1. A denunciation of Death and Damnation is neither a Rule nor Goſpel; it's very abſurd to ſay that is a Rule, if you live after the Fleſh; it's but a condemnation of what's contrary to the Rule, and a denunciation upon a ſuppoſing of that Abberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Rule: Suppoſitions are not always Poſitions, that the thing ſuppoſed is ever in being, and they are uſed by way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation; becauſe the Antecedent can't be, therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent can't be; or becauſe the Conſequent can't be, therefore the Antecedent can't be, <hi>&amp; vice verſa.</hi> There's in this kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>A Ponere</hi> or <hi>Tollere,</hi> in reſpect of one part of the Propoſition, to take away or eſtabliſh the other, as now in the Propoſition you boaſt of. If a true Believer (for ſo you ſhould ſay) yield up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the dominion of Sin, he ſhall Periſh; but a true Believer ſhall not yield up himſelf to the Dominion of Sin; therefore, he ſhall not periſh. Make but the Propoſition into a Syllogiſm, that it may argue, and it will prove, that a true Believer ſhall not Periſh, becauſe he ſhall not yield up himſelf to the dominion of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.14. 2. I deny that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.13. of true Believers, but uſeth an Argument to unhinge and looſe Profeſſors from vain hopes, and to ſhew that they are not in Chriſt.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56391:217"/> For <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. he ſaith, They that are in the Fleſh can't pleaſe God; to ſuch as are in the Fleſh, he oppoſeth them that are in the Spirit, and having the Spirit of Chriſt are his: Therefore, he ſaith, All ſuch are Debtors to live after the Spirit, and not after the Fleſh; for if ye that are Profeſſors to live after the Spirit, do really live after the Fleſh, you are in a periſhing ſtate, you are in the Fleſh. Now the Apoſtle's arguing looks two ways, 1. To prove they that are in Chriſt ſhall not die; they that ſhall not live after the Fleſh, ſhall not die; but a Believer in Chriſt, ſhall not live after the Fleſh. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ſhall not dy. 2. by way of diſcovery, He that lives after the Fleſh, is in the Fleſh, and can't pleaſe God, and therefore muſt die in that ſtate, if it continue: But you or I live ſo; therefore, the Apoſtle ſpeaks it by way of trial of the Truth of our ſtate, and in-being in Chriſt. 3. Where is it that the Doctor ſpeaks ſo favourably, as you would have him, of the dominion of Sin? You have not referred to the place: The neareſt is <hi>pag.</hi> 429. where he hath theſe words, <q>Forget every thing that ſeems worthy in you or done by you, and let all your triumphing and glorying be in the free Grace of God, in Chriſt; and look upon yourſelf only in that, and nothing elſe; as the Martyr did, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt. If you have more ability than others, in doing, let it not come into your Thoughts, as an inducement to think better of yourſelf; as if you were more accepted of God, or pleaſing in his ſight. Are you ſinful in reſpect of the prevalency of Corruption? Are the Temptations of Satan mighty? Let it not come into your Thoughts that you are worſe or leſs than others; for Iniquity ſhall not part Chriſt and thee, if thou be once joined to him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Where is here the ſaying, that if Sin hath dominion over a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, he ſhall not periſh? But this is all along your way, to forge the Horſe-ſhooe firſt, and then nail it to what Foot you pleaſe.</p>

It's the hurt of the Daughter of <hi>Zion;</hi> why is it ſaid that we are healed by the ſtripes of Chriſt? And that Sin, even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in God's People, makes the beſt of God's Peoples Services and Duties as Droſs and Dung, by reaſon of its mixture with them, which you condemn for an Error? We ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 509. let us not be miſtaken: We do not ſay we muſt not be afraid to Sin; but that they that have God for their God, need not be afraid of the Sins they have committed, in regard of the penal Effects. <q>But that Sin naturally is a Root, bringing forth all manner of evil Fruit; <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> We diſtinguiſh of fear, a natural fear, an affection in Men by Nature, that they cannot be freed from; there's a religious and godly fear, which is an awful reverence of the Majeſty of God, and keeping a convenient diſtance, ſuch as the Creature ought to keep, it's oppoſed to Saucineſs. And there's a turbulent fear, a fear of diſquietneſs, that which the Lord endeavours to take off from his People.</q>

                        <p>All ſuch fear, the Apoſtle ſaith, hath Bondage, and perfect Love caſts it out: And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, as I ſay. <hi>Theſe things I write unto you, that ye ſin not. But if any Man ſin (i. e.</hi> hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sin) <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is a propitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. Therefore you charge us falſly to ſay our meaning is, That Sin, in it ſelf, is no hurt, and in its Nature doth no hurt: But we ſay as you, That Chriſt ſatisfied Juſtice for Sin, and over-rules the hurt of it for our good, ſo that through Grace it doth us no real hurt; Chriſt hath taken away the ſting of Sin, and the Condemnation of Sin. The real hurt of Sin lies in the dominion of Sin, and in the penal effects of it, they that have God for their God can't give up themſelves to the dominion of Sin; they can't have a love for it, becauſe they are under grace; and as to the penal Effects, they are taken away by Chriſt, or elſe his ſatisfaction to Juſtice was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Now all other Effects of ſin, as hiding God's Face, his paternal Chaſtiſements, in outward Afflictions, ecclipſing our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and duties, come under a Promiſe, that tho' they are not joyous, but grievous to a gracious Mind, yet they ſhall, through God's grace diſpoſing them, tend to our good, in making us the more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56391:219"/> Partakers of God's Holineſs, to mortify ſin, to humble us and empty us of our ſelves, and to bring us to an higher exaltation of Chriſt and dependance upon him, yea, to more watchfulneſs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and circumſpection in our ways. Hence God's People have their frequent complaints againſt Sin, as to its indwelling and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them from doing the good they would, groan under the body of Sin, and deſire Heaven to be altogether rid of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But when we ſay, ſin cannot do us real hurt, and we ſhould not be afraid of it, we mean only of ſins already fallen into, that the diſturbing, diſquieting guilt of them ſhould not lye upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to obſtruct our Comforts, and rejoycing in Chriſt; they ſhould not drive us from Chriſt, to deny the love and free grace of God and the alſufficiency of Chriſt; for if he that hath God for his God lyes continually under an embondaging fear of ſins paſt, he would always labour under a ſervile, ſlaviſh frame of ſpirit, without comfort all his days: We need not repeat what hath been ſaid to vindicate ourſelves from this unjuſt Charge.</p>

The reaſon why Hell (you ſay) follows not the Sin of a Believer, is not the innocency of Sin;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56391:219"/> this is one of the black-mouthed Charges you lay upon us, that we make Sin innocent, becauſe we ſay, Sin was laid on Chriſt, and he hath born all the Penal Effects of Sin. Why ſay you not the ſame of the Apoſtle, who ſaith the ſtrength of Sin is taken away, and the ſting of Death, (whereby it or leſſer afflictions can't hurt) is taken away? Theſe abominable Reproaches fall not on Man, ſo much as upon the Truths of the Goſpel, which Chriſt hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with you for. And that Hell follows not the Sin of a Believer, you ſay, is from the grace God; and why may it not be from the grace of God, that no Penal Effects follow the Sin of a Believer?

If he did not bear all the Indignation of the Lord, then he doth not ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. I ſay not to the uttermoſt, becauſe here is ſome Indignation and Diſpleaſure left behind, and for lack of taking this Indignation upon himſelf, it lights and falls upon Believers. So that either you muſt ſay, Chriſt is an imperfect Saviour, having left ſome ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Wrath behind, that will fall on the head of a Believer: Or elſe you will ſay, he is a perfect Saviour, and takes away all God's diſpleaſure; then there remains none of it upon the perſon of a Believer.</q>

And as there is the ſame contrariety in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56391:222"/> Sin againſt his nature, ſo there is the ſame contrariety in God's nature unto Sin. All contrarieties have a mutual contrariety againſt each other, as Water and Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As Sin is contrary to the nature of God, ſo there is an Abhorrency of God to that Sinfulneſs, [here ſee with what ground you could ſay, that Dr. <hi>C.</hi> makes Sin Innocent,] but there is no Offence of God to the Perſon that commits that Sin, becauſe the Offence of God for that Sin hath ſpent it ſelf upon the Perſon of Chriſt, there remains none of it to light upon the perſon of a Believer, Chriſt having born all this Offence for Sin. — Tho' in our Natures, and in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them, there is matter of diſpleaſure, yet in Chriſt, for all this, God is well pleaſed with us. And yet there is none of God's Indignation againſt Sin loſt in all this, for he is ſatisfied for this his Offence in his Son, more than in our own Perſons.</p>

                        <q>The Words were thus, I ſee the Scripture runs wholy in this ſtrain, and is ſo full in nothing as in this, that he hath generally diſcharged the Sins of Believers. Oh then take heed of falling into the Errour of the Papiſts, that ſay, that God hath taken away the Sin, but not the Wrath of God due to Sin, but that he hath forgiven our Sins, but not the Puniſhment of Sin; but conſider, that as our Sins were then upon Chriſt, he was ſo Bruiſed for our Iniquities, as that by his Stripes we are healed, and the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was ſo upon him, that he being Chaſtiſed for our Sins, there is nothing but Peace belongs to us.</q>
                        <p>And can you deny the Truth of a plain place of Scripture, <hi>The Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him?</hi> Doth it plainly appear that this is true meaning, that our Peace was fully made by Chriſt, and accordingly he is called our Peace? Chriſt ſaith, in the World we

                        <q>God, ſaith he, hath made ſuch an Oath, that the Earth ſhall be drowned with Water before it be broken,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Dr.</hi> C. p. 160.</note> that he will not be Wroth with his People, nor Rebuke them any more; and upon this account, it is he ſaith, that ſuch as tell Believers, Except they do this or that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will come under Wrath and Condemnation, do abuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and give God the Lie; nay, he ſaith, we do not only, ſo much as lies in us, to make God a Liar, [the Scripture ſaith Unbelief doth ſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.] but we offer an inſufferable Affront unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtrike at the very heart of the Office of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip. If we ſay, God is Wroth with Believers for whom Chriſt died, for what end did Chriſt ſuffer Death? I ſay, that if this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple be truth, that God will be Wroth with his People, then Chriſt died in vain, for God could have been but Wroth and Angry with his People if Chriſt had not died; to bring the People of God under Wrath and Vengeance again, is to take away all the Vertue of the Death of Chriſt, and to make it of none effect.</q>
                        <p>Now why do you not Anſwer this Argument? this is the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſheſt thing in the World, to ſay, he ſaith ſo, and he ſaith ſo, why do you not tell People why he ſaith ſo, and Confute his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? but you think you have done enough, if you have Expoſed a Doctrin, by ſaying, this or that Man that profeſſeth to hold it, ſaith ſo and ſo; therefore what if a Man ſpeak truth never ſo weakly, and abſurdly, muſt the truth be reckoned errour therefore?</p>

                        <p>You ſay, Tho' he be not <hi>ſo angry,</hi> you make degrees of Anger in God thereby, as if God were partly pleaſed, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with his Children; and if ſo at one time, then at another (we ſpeak of the Perſons of Believers) there being always ſin in them for a reaſon here; and if ſo, Chriſt was not our full Peace, he did not reconcile God fully to us, therefore made imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſatisfaction; for if there remains ſome part of the Debt yet unpaid, Chriſt did not pay all. Again, to be under the Penalty of the Law for ſin, and the execution thereof, tho' but in part, is ſo far to be under the Curſe; but there's no Believers in whole or in part, under the Curſe. Again, God, you ſay, is not ſo diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them as to caſt them out of Covenant; if not, then they continue in Covenant with God; if in Covenant, then he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Covenant-love towards them, then he always acts in a way of Covenant-love towards them, even for their amendment and not deſtruction, when he afflicts them not in a way of wrathful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for their ſins: But if you ſay, againſt their ſins, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, and God is always angry with ſin; ſin itſelf was never pleaſing to God, and therefore he purgeth it out in Sanctification every day; and hence ſpends many a Rod upon them for their Profit, as a good Father upon a Child that he dearly loves: Some earthly Fathers may correct for their pleaſure, that is, to vent their Anger and Paſſion; but God, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Corrects for our Profit,</hi> Heb. 12.10. And he ſaith, <hi>Whom he loveth he chaſtneth, v.</hi> 6. i. e. loveth at the very ſame time. God's divine love to the Perſons of Believers cannot be abated in the leaſt: It's true, God may alter his Carriage towards them, and deal ſo with them, as to make them conſider their ways, and to humble them, or to point out ſome Corruption God will have mortifyed; this is all love in God, and not diſpleaſure: God's ſeeming diſpleaſure is a fruit of his unchangeable loving kindneſs towards them; and whatever you ſay, if I ſtand ſecured of God's Covenant favour, I am ſure God cannot be angry with me, whatever his ſenſible Carriages are. God's People, whatever God's dealings are with them, they do not take any thing to be done in diſpleaſure, till through Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they begin to ſuſpect their Covenant-ſtate: Do but clear up to an afflicted Perſon God's Covenant-favour, and I'll warrant you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56391:223"/> he will not ſay God hath afflicted him in his diſpleaſure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will ſay God is diſpleaſed with their Perſons, for their ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> puniſheth them for their ſins to ſatisfie his diſpleaſure thereby, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Juſtice; if ſo, it's clear the conſequence is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, as to ſo much of my puniſhment for ſin that I bear, Chriſt did not bear, beſides it muſt be in its degree expiatory and ſatisfactory to God.</p>

                           <p>From the Doctrin of Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, we gather, 1. To condemn the proud Papiſts,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>

God having accepted his Son's Righteouſneſs for us, will not hold us any longer treſpaſſers, but he diſables his own Juſtice from making any further demand. 2.

                        <p>If you pleaſe, Sir, you ſhall have my whole ſenſe, the ſum briefly of what I ſpake.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>I was preaching from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. I opened that Text according to the ſenſe of the beſt Interpreters; and I ſhewed, that the Apoſtle, 1. demoliſheth all glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and rotten Materials, wherewith he had, and others ſtill do, erect a fortreſs of ſecurity and a place of delight, <hi>Dr.</hi> C. <hi>p.</hi> 226. 2. He declares his end in ſo doing, that he might lay a ſure Foundation, and build upon it with other Materials than Hay and Stubble, <hi>p.</hi> 227. Now I ſhewed, that which he caſt away, was all things, not only what he was or could do before he received Chriſt, but even all things whatever alſo he hath been able to do ſince he received Chriſt, tho' aſſiſted thereto by the Spirit of Chriſt, as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerves. As concerning the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's end, for ſtripping himſelf naked of his moſt ſpecious Works in general, it is to be cloathed with white Robes, even the Garment of Salvation; but more eſpecially he declares his end, 1. It's for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Chriſt's Excellencies known; to the knowledge of which I could never come, till all I was, and am, plainly appeared loſs and dung; my own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was a thick Film over my Eyes, that I could not ſee Chriſt's Worth. 2. A gaining and winning Chriſt, is a ſecond end, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, as long as his own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was in requeſt with him, and ſeemed any thing better than dung in his eye, he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56391:228"/> could never get Chriſt. 3. That he might be found in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> at the great day of appearance. That this is the meaning, is plain by the Apoſtle's own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding himſelf, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, and my Doctrin.</p>
                           <p>That things, even the moſt blameleſs walking according to God's Law, not only before, but after converſion, or receiving Chriſt, is truly counted loſs and dung, by a <hi>Paul</hi>'s Eye; and ſuch an one will be willing to ſuffer the loſs thereof as dung.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe places were brought in proof, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.</p>
                           <p>And I ſhew'd this determination was not to be of ſome things only, but of all; not only things directly againſt the Precept, but all Civility, Morality, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt obedience, with the higheſt aſſiſtance of the Spirit, and ſtraighteſt aim at a right end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be counted and ſentenced but as loſs and dung.</p>
                           <p>But let me not he miſtaken; here I do not ſay, that the Motions themſelves of the Spirit, as his, nor the Ends and Enlargements of the Heart, as his, or the Ends aimed at, as preſcribed, muſt be thus accounted or ſentenced; but the whole Work as done, and when done by a ſanctified perſon thus aſſiſted and qualified: when ſuch a perſon looks at the Work ſo done by him, he muſt ſee nothing but meer loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dung. 1. Loſs, becauſe that he forfeits Life and Bliſs on Earth and Heaven; there is ſin enough in it, if God had nothing elſe but what he could pick out of the beſt Work to lay to his charge; I mean, in regard of the deſert of ſuch a Work in itſelf conſidered; under the notion of ſuch loſs muſt it be lookt on: And as Dung alſo, which comprehends the cauſality of ſuch loſs in theſe Works. All things of ours, even the beſt, are of this nature; I ſay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our Righteouſneſs, at beſt, is ſuch a menſtruous Cloath in Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Let us conſider what it is to ſuffer the loſs of all things:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. There is a Paſſive Suffering, the loſs of all things, when a perſon is violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bereft of all. 2. There is an Active or Voluntary Suffering, the loſs of all, <hi>i. e.</hi> he was contented to take ſhame to himſelf for his beſt Actions, and account himſelf worthy to be caſt out and deſtroyed, and to be his own Judge, to paſs not only the Sentence of Confiſcation of all, but of Condemnation on his Perſon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O wretched Man, that I am,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo to ſtand ſtripp'd ſtark naked of all things, and all Pleas they can afford him, ſo that not to have a word to ſpeak for himſelf, that his Mouth ſhould be ſtopped, except it be in impleading all that ever he had done, as making againſt him far more than for him. And I came to the third thing, to ſhew how all things, even the moſt blameleſs Works after reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are loſs and dung: For illuſtration ſake, You muſt diſtinguiſh between that which is the Spirits in Works after renovation, and the whole Work after we have done it; and now followed what he rehears'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where I ſhewed, that tho' the Motions and Aſſiſtances of the Spirit be pure and holy without Scum in the Spring, yet by that time they are mixed with our manifold Corruptions in doing, and have paſſed through the Channels of our corrupt Hearts, the whole Work becomes polluted and filthy, as pure Water paſſing through a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this I evinced from <hi>James,</hi> who ſaith, that whoſoever fulfills the whole Law of God, and yet offends in one point, is guilty of all: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me;</hi> and complains thus, <hi>O wretched Man, that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> and he doth not fly to his good Works, but to Chriſt, a Refuge againſt all, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                              <hi>Object.</hi> But ought we to refrain therefore from doing righteouſneſs? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not; but therefore we muſt refrain from glorying in it, or ſtroaking our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for our righteous doings; rather take ſhame to ourſelves when done, and ſo glory only in the Lord: And tho' good Works, as done by us, are but dung in themſelves and in God's eye, yet muſt we be careful to maintain them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3. confeſſeth, that his goodneſs extendeth not to God, but to the Saints.

                        <p>I perceive the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Antinomian</hi> fully, for he ſaith, 1. That the Graces of the Spirit come clean from the Fountain. 2. That when they come into the Channels of our corrupt Hearts, they become mixt with the dirt and filth of them. 3. That thence our beſt Duties and Services become polluted. 4. That thereby they are not pleadable for righteouſneſs before God. 5. We have no cauſe to boaſt ourſelves, after Duties to ſtroak and commend ourſelves as if we had done a great matter, but to go off from Duty with humiliation and ſhame. 6. That all or any compared with the Holineſs and Purity of God, in reſpect of our coming ſhort of what is required, the mixture of ſin working in us, makes this Duty and Work done, as it is in it ſelf conſidered, to be but dung.</p>
                        <p>Now, Mr. <hi>Neonomian,</hi> what do you think or ſay of your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when they are done? when you have ſpent a day in Faſting and Prayer, would you not at the end of the day, deſire the Lord to pardon the Iniquity of your Holy Things, your Wanderings, Vain Thoughts ſtirring of manifold Corruptions, would you not ſay as <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 9.18. <hi>We do not preſent our Supplications before thee for our Righteouſneſs, but for thy great Mercies?</hi> Ought we not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Ourſelves and Duties in Duſt and Aſhes, and ſay, Lord, if thou mark the Iniquities of our beſt Duties, they are enough to condemn us for ever to Eternal Wrath? How often is this ſpoken and thought by the beſt of God's Children? Or would you go off the Duty like the proud Phariſee, commending and ſtroaking yourſelf for what you had done, ſaying at laſt in your Heart, I have Pray'd well this day, Preach'd well; tho' there was ſome Imperfections, yet there was as much as God requires of me to the fulfilling the New Law; I have performed the Condition, and God muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it for the ſake of my Evangelical Righteouſneſs?</p>

But I perceive what you aim at, that it is a Righteouſneſs that comes in for a ſhare with Chriſt, and in part it prevails to Acceptation, tho' not altogether, and here you fall in with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as in all your Doctrin, <q>That the Grace of Juſtification and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not only the favour of God, and by the Merit of Chriſt, but that our Works prevail in ſome degree.</q>

It's that which is not commonly received, and therefore he is ſingle in it. 2. It's a Tropical Senſe, he makes the Abſtract put for the Concrete, and what need of ſuch a Senſe, when there's no reaſon to ſuppoſe ſuch a Trope in the Words? And that's againſt the general Rules of Interpretation.</p>

                           <q>He ſaith, That which induced thoſe both Ancienter and later Writers to bring within compaſs of this Doom, in this place, thoſe defects and defaults adhering to, and alloying the pureſt Practices of the moſt Sincere, ſeems to have been, becauſe the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Our Righteouſneſſes,</hi> as ſpeaking in his own Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſaith, The Words may well be underſtood, with thoſe Jewiſh Doctors, for thoſe Semblances of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs that was among them,</q> [ſo that by our Righteouſneſs may well be underſtood, our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſies,] but he rather recommends his Genuine Senſe, and what's that? The Prophet hath a very remote meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſpeaks of our Righteouſneſſes, and he means Righteous Men, and not Righteous Men neither, but Wicked and Corrupt Men, Bryars and Thorns, ſuch as the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.4. plain Bryars and Thorns; and now here's a plain Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture merely ſham'd off, and delivered up into the hands of the Papiſts, and ſo we ſhall trick off one Text after another, till they have got them all.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledg that which the Jewiſh Interpreters ſay, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Perſonates the Church in this Prayer; but then he Perſonates the very beſt of them, as well as the very corrupt and degenerate part, for after the Churches deſire, that God would wonderfully appear for her Deliverance and Reformation, as formerly he had done, <hi>Ch.</hi> 64.1, 2, 3. ſhe lays the Caſe of Two ſorts that were among them before the Lord; the Holy and Sincere, and the Corrupt

The Prophet inſiſts upon the deſcription of them, that we might not be miſtaken; and ſuppoſe that he meant the Prophane or Hypocritical part, they are ſuch as work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and God meets, that Rejoice in God's ways; and tho' they are under the National Wrathful Calamities, yet ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; which muſt be underſtood of Spiritual Salvation, for they were to take their ſhare with others in the Captivity, and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Calamities in them were continuance; hence the Holieſt and Beſt proſtrate themſelves, and acknowledg their Faith of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not built upon any Righteouſneſs or Worthineſs of their own. For the Nation had not only ſinned, but they had ſinned and fallen ſhort of their Duty in their beſt performances, and we are ſo far from pleading or rejoicing in our own Righteouſneſs, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, (for in the Old Teſtament Dialect, Perſonal Holineſs is often called Righteouſneſs,) that we are all as an Unclean Thing, we are Polluted with ſo much Sin and Corruption, and our very Righteouſneſs and Holineſs are as Filthy Rags, our Goodneſs is as the Morning-Dew, we fade as a Leaf towards Autumn, and our Iniquities have withered us. We ſee, the whole Nation, under the Bliting Winds of thy Diſpleaſure for its Iniquities: And then he proceeds to ſhew how great a ſcarcity there was of thoſe that were Sincere, for there's few that call upon God, there's none, <hi>i. e.</hi> but a very few comparatively, [there was never ſo an Apoſtate time but there's ſome, as in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time,] that calleth upon thy Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſincerely and earneſtly, ſo as to ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to call upon God; then ſhe proceeds to confeſs Sin, and bemoan her ſelf in regard of deſolating Calamities, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Juſtice and Soveraignty, but Appealing to his Mercy, and their Intereſt in God as a Father, <hi>O Lord thou art our Father.</hi> Its moſt evident then the Prophet moſtly perſonates the choiſeſt, tho' the leaſt part of the Church, who is ſet forth here, flying to the Throne of Grace, and renouncing her own Righteouſneſs, even her beſt Duties, accounting them as Filthy Rags.

Who doubts but when he ſaith his own Righteouſneſs, it is his own Righteouſneſs; and this is not to be fetcht from ſome ſorry Conjectures which Men (when they are in ſtreights) invent to avoid preſent ruin, but from ſtable, fixed, conſtant uſe in Scripture; my own Righteouſneſs is as my own or your own Works taken for real ſincere conformity of Heart and Life to a Law; and this is the fixed uſe in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.33. <hi>My Righteouſneſs ſhall anſwer for me.</hi> You Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi> would Paraphraſe upon it thus, <hi>My Roguery ſhall anſwer for me,</hi> Job 27.6.

                        <q>This proceeds upon a double falſe Suppoſition. 1. That the Apoſtle renounceth nothing but what he retained while a Phariſee. 2. Whatever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced did conſtitute his Phariſaical Righteouſneſs. 1. I muſt cut him off from Circumciſion, that was no part of his own Righteouſneſs, unleſs you have a ſpice of the Doctrin of imputing the Righteouſneſs of another Perſon for Juſtification. 2. For Sacrifices, the Apoſtle mentions them not, knowing they were the viſible Goſpel of the Jewiſh Church, and did lead to Chriſt. As to his being of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. they might expect ſome favours thence; but that any were ſo far bewitched as to believe, that all the Stock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Nation of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be juſtified, cannot be proved. 4. For civility and blameleſneſs of Converſation, it may be it may go a great way in your Account.</q>
                        <p>But I find you take but little notice of it here, but place <hi>Paul</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, which he renounced, with that of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, the Conciſion, his rejection of Chriſt, Opinion of Jewiſh Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abuſe of the Moſaick frame, a fine Parcel of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he ſurely miſnamed it; he ſhould have called that his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Villany.</p>

                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56391:239"/>But whatever <hi>Paul</hi> was or was not, whilſt a Phariſee, it makes no great matter to the Buſineſs in Hand, ſeeing he hath ſo freely and openly diſown'd whatever was his own Righteouſneſs after Converſion, in the matter of Juſtification before God, <hi>Antiſozzo. p.</hi> 554.</q>

He makes no diſtinction that Works are of two ſorts, ſome excluded from Juſtification, and not others; but he expreſly rejects his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> his perſonal inherent Righteouſneſs, whatever it be and however it be wrought. 3. He makes a plain diſtinction of his twofold Eſtate: 1. That of Judaiſm before Converſion. 2. He proceeds to give an account of himſelf and Eſtate after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.

For whereas ſome begin to interpret our being in Chriſt, and being found in him, ſo as to intend no more but our Profeſſion of the Faith of the Goſpel; the Faith of the Catholick Church in all Ages, concerning the Myſtical Union of Chriſt and Believers, is not to be blown away with a few empty Words and unproved Aſſertions.</p>

You have heard what reckoning the Apoſtle had of his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in his unregenerate ſtate, and upon the diſcovery of Chriſt unto him, he came to a loſs of all that which before he counted gain: Now, in this Verſe, he goes on to ſhew you what account he had ſtill of Chriſt, and of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt, after ſome ſtrength, and experience he had of Chriſt; yea, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, any more than ſo? Yea, and more than that, I account them ſtill; it is a rhetorical Speech, wherein the Apoſtle riſeth higher in his expreſſion with greater overflow of affection, verifying all things beſides Chriſt as loſs and dung; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it three times over, (a note of affection) I count all things loſs, I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the loſs, I account them but dung, and then it is for Chriſt, and that Chriſt who is my Lord. Suppoſe the Apoſtle had been thus ſpoken to; 'tis true, you forſook all your former Gains, and you profeſſed all ſhould go for Chriſt; your ſelf, your Wealth, your Zeal, your Righteouſneſs in the Law, you valued all as nothing, while Chriſt was new and freſh in your memory, and before you had taſted of his Yoak and Croſs. But what ſay you now, <hi>Paul?</hi> now you have been beaten with Rods, ſtoned, Shipwrackt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. What now <hi>Paul,</hi> are you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56391:240"/> of the ſame mind ſtill? is not your Courage cooled? Nay, doubleſs, (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) I did, and I do, I am not changed, I do account all things, I reſerve not one thing to lye between me and Chriſt; not my good Works, not any thing within me, nor without me, that I value or eſteem; my Righteouſneſs, my Obedience to the Law, my Faſting, my Scourging, I count them but Loſs and Dung for Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.— p.</hi> 19, 20.</p>

                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. That gracious Duties and Performances of a Man in the ſtate of Grace, are to be diſclaimed in the matter of his Juſtification, or his Righteouſneſs before God— <hi>p.</hi> 44. —</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>V.</hi> 1. The Papiſts will not hear this Doctrin; for tho', with much ado, they will quit their good Works, that are done in an unregenerate ſtate without and before Faith; yet thoſe Works of a regenerate Man, that are beſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt, [Here's your Doctrin, Mr. <hi>Neonomian</hi>] they will have them come in for their Juſtification: for thus they ſay Chriſt merits for us, that we may merit for ourſelves; that Chriſt is our Saviour, by making us our own Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; Chriſt is our juſtifier, by making us juſtifie ourſelves; he giveth us Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and we lay it down, what is this? It is to keep up good Duties, (ſay they and you) which otherwiſe would fall to the ground; whereas the true Spring and Whetſtone of Obedience to God, is Faith and Love, and Thankfulneſs upon the apprehenſion of the Pardon of our Sins: let a Man have Chriſt for his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and let a Man be ungodly if he can; the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, <hi>&amp;c. — p.</hi> 44, 45, 46.</p>
                           <p>— This Phraſe of Speech, All things Loſs and but Dung; mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs both before and after Grace; I count all to be but Dung, that I may win Chriſt — There is the Faith of Adventure, and the Faith of Aſſurance — <hi>p.</hi> 129.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Proof of Doctrin.</hi> 'Tis for the gaining of Chriſt, that a Chriſtian counteth all things in the World as Dung, and ſuffereth the loſs of all things.</p>
                           <p>It's a ſtrange trade, that a Man muſt loſe to gain; he muſt be a Beggar and Bankrupt, that he may be rich; he muſt be nothing, that he may have Chriſt— Yea, his Works after Grace received; all that I did know, and all that I do know ſtill, I do count them but as Dung, that I may win Chriſt — <hi>p.</hi> 126.</p>
                           <p>— There is nothing can be done in a Man, that proveth him to be out of Wrath any farther than it proveth him to be in Chriſt. In this Argument lyes all the ſtrength that Chriſt is yours, and that you are Chriſts; what other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments otherwiſe you have, that will not prove this Point, are all but Fallacies, and your Hopes are but Ropes of Sand. Dreſs up yourſelves in the beſt Attire you have— Vertue, Civility, Learning, Excellent Parts, let them paint over the rotten Face of corrupt Nature never ſo curiouſly, will all this prove, that you ſhall be ſaved? — The Apoſtle counteth all this but Stuff and Lumber, Traſh, Loſs and Dung for Chriſt: Can you climb Heaven by any Ladder of Nature's erecting? What Ladder reacheth to Heaven, but <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder? which was a Type of Chriſt? <hi>p.</hi> 147.</p>
                           <p>Let me come to the Graces of God's Spirit: They prove, that you are out of the ſtate of Wrath, that you ſhall be ſaved; but how do they prove it? Not as the cauſes thereof: doth your Grace, that is in you, ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and redeem you from the Curſe, and pay the Ranſom? Is it your Title for Salvation? Do you pretend to have him upon the Worth of your Graces? Like a Man that's queſtioned about his Land, goes about to prove the worth of the Land by the wax with which [his Deeds] are ſealed,— the Seal is more than the Wax— therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, not only we are tranſlated, but hereby we know we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56391:241"/> are tranſlated. Now how doth Grace ſignifie to you, that you are out of Wrath? As it evidences you to be in Chriſt, and ſo the Sign bringeth you to the Cauſe. —If they prove but unto you the Work of Grace in your Heart, and that you are in Chriſt, you need ask them no more, they have done enough, they have ſetled you upon a ſure ground — The leaſt Dram of Grace is worth a 1000 Tun of ſuch kind of ſtuff of Moral Righteouſneſs, which may be in you and not prove you to be in Chriſt: A little Seal is worth a Cart-load of Wax, becauſe it ſealeth more to me than the Wax is worth; ſo the leaſt Dram of Grace, wrought in a Man that is in Jeſus Chriſt, is worth a World of Moral Duties, becauſe it ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Evidences, Pardon of Sin, Favour with God; therefore examine yourſelves that you take not a Human-Faith for a Saving-Faith, <hi>&amp;c. — p.</hi> 148, 149, 150.</p>

                           <p>Theſe two ſorts are firſt deſcribed what they are; Legal, mine own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the Law; Evangelical, the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by the Faith of Chriſt. 2.

                           <p>
                              <hi>Doct.</hi> There are two ſorts of Righteouſneſs, Legal and Evangelical, the one of the Law, the other of the Goſpel; for that which we call Righteouſneſs with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56391:241"/> God, is the ſame which we call Goſpel or Evangelical Righteouſneſs, which is plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                           <p>Now do not ſtumble at this, do not think I mean (as you do Mr. <hi>Neonom.</hi>) that there are two ſorts of Righteouſneſſes which a Sinner may be juſtified by, <hi>For by one Righteouſneſs we are juſtified with God,</hi> Rom. 5.18. But when I ſay there are two ſorts, it is to be underſtood thus; there are but two ſorts of Righteouſneſſes by which Life at any time hath been attained, there never was a third Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby a Man ſhould be Righteous with God, ever propounded to Man ſtanding or falling: (Where's your ſubordinate Righteouſneſs now?) There are, there have been, there can be no more; the own is his own, the other is that which is called the Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
                           <p>Now to deſcribe theſe two ſorts of Righteouſneſs, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10, 11.</p>
                           <p>Theſe two, doing and believing, are the Characteriſtical Words that deſcribe theſe two ſorts of Righteouſneſſes, of the Law and of the Goſpel.

                        <q>Mr. <hi>R. Vines,</hi> But I tell you, the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel is for a Sinner, a Sinner overwhelmed and overſpread with Sins.</q>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>R. V.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of the Law is an exact compliance with the Law of God in every Tittle; the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, is the Righteouſneſs of another, the Righteouſneſs of God in him; of another, in another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt.</p>
                           <p>Now take this for a Rule, What Righteouſneſs ſoever it be that juſtifieth a Man with God it muſt be perfect, whether it be a Righteouſneſs of the Law or the Goſpel: Again, it muſt be his own. Now that it is our own, it is not meant as if the Goſpel Righteouſneſs was not ours; tho' it be not our own origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, yet it muſt be ours derivatively from Chriſt; it is not our own, being in us, but it is ours by Imputation, imputed or accounted to us; it is not our own by Works, but it is ours by Faith; it is not our own of our ſelves, but its ours of God.</p>

                           <hi>Then you may thruſt me and my Book both out of Doors, for it hath been my Deſign wholly throughout my Book to eſtabliſh this Righteouſneſs of our own theſe three ways.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>To join it with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in Juſtification, under the Name of ſubordinate Righteouſneſs, and a Condition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>To foiſt it into the Grace of God as a Motive under the Name of Meetneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>To give it the ſame place and nature in Juſtification, as Faith, in that I make Faith to juſtifie as its doing, and as a working Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>R. V.</hi> Out of this Deſcription we ſhall take up four Points.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. They that are in Chriſt have Righteouſneſs with God; there's an Emphaſis in the words, they that are in Chriſt have the Righteouſneſs, the only Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Papiſts ſay, We have Righteouſneſs by Works; we ſay we have it by Imputation, yet they that have this Righteouſneſs by Imputation, have it truly, and they are made Righteous by it, <hi>pag.</hi> 176. They have this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God; mark, they have that which ſets them right with God, into a ſtate of favour and acceptation, that which diſchargeth all Guilt and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They have that which freeth them from every Charge, every Endictment, every Sentence of the Law of God; they have that which ſetteth them into Friendſhip and Peace with God, that which entitleth them to Eternal Life and Heaven: They have that, which altho' it doth not take away the being of Sin, yet it ſetteth them as free from Hell as <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, and ſetteth them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſure Centre; that Faith wherein we ſtand, outſpeaks <hi>Adam,</hi> even <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Integrity, <hi>p.</hi> 176.</p>
                           <p n="2">2dly, This Righteouſneſs which they have in Chriſt is the Righteouſneſs of God; this is a Phraſe frequent with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and is almoſt peculiar to him. Now, mark, that Righteouſneſs whereby a poor Sinner is made Righteous with God is the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a Perſon who is God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.16. Not his eſſential Righteouſneſs, it's only that Righteouſneſs which is from God; that which God imputeth to us, that which he hath provided, appointed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to be a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice; that's the Righteouſneſs of God which God hath made to be ſo to us, and that is Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>p.</hi> 180</p>
                           <p n="3">3dly, This Righteouſneſs of God is by Faith; God hath appointed this humble Grace of Faith to be in the hand of the Receiver, which taketh hold of this Righteouſneſs of God. But now you muſt conſider this Faith not [as Mr. <hi>Neono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> doth] as a Habit or Quality, but conſider it in the Office it hath, as it is an Inſtrument taking hold of Jeſus Chriſt: Not, I ſay, as a habit for the worthineſs of Faith it ſelf; for tho' it be ſaid, by Faith, it is not ſaid, for Faith; by it as an Inſtrument of God, for hereby you come to the Promiſes, and to Chriſt; cloſing with Chriſt by Faith you are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. It is a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying Faith that caſteth out Pride, and Self, and Works, and cometh naked and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56391:243"/> poor to the rich Promiſes of Chriſt, and there hanged, taketh hold and claſpeth faſt.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This Faith by which you have the Righteouſneſs of God is the Faith of Chriſt, or (which is all one) of the which Promiſes hold forth Chriſt, they are the object of this Faith by which you have the Righteouſneſs of God; it's true, the object of Faith is the whole Word of God, and that doth not juſtifie becauſe it works Faith: the Eye ſeeth other things beſides the brazen Serpent, but as it healeth it looketh to the brazen Serpent only, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 185.</p>
                           <p>Now I come to the deſcription of the other ſort of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. There is a Righteouſneſs called our own, which is of the Law. 2. Our own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law is to be utterly diſclaimed, our own in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith in Chriſt: As the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is the very ſame with that which is by the Faith of Chriſt, for they are all one; ſo our own Righteouſneſs is that which is of the Law. Now that there is a Righteouſneſs which is called our own, is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. to open the Righteouſneſs of the Law.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Righteouſneſs of the Law is nothing elſe but a conformity to the Law. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17. the Duties which is the Matter muſt be done with all the Mind and Strength, and all the Soul. —</p>
                           <p n="2">2. What is meant by our own Righteouſneſs? It is that whereby we walk in ſome conformity to the Law of God; and if you will have Works done from a natural Principle or Power by the ſtrength of moral Vertues, by Men out of Chriſt, this is indeed within ourſelves, and this is our own Righteouſneſs, like that the Apoſtle calleth his Gain before he knew Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>But then for holy Duties or Works that are performed, which flow from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of renewing Grace, this (ſay the Papiſts) is not our own Righteouſneſs. For the clearing this Point: All your Works that flow from ſanctifying Graces, in conformity to the Law of God, all theſe come under the Name of our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, not becauſe it is of our ſelves efficiently, but it is ours ſubjectively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us. As <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, his own, though it came from an inward Holineſs and Righteouſneſs given him of God. — Are not the Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as Love, Joy, Temperance, are they not our own? They are our own or Gods; if our own, then I have the Point; if the Righteouſneſs of God, then you are juſtified by the Fruits of the Spirit, and not by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, which is the greateſt Error in Divinity. If the Apoſtle in this Text had ſaid, Not my own Righteouſneſs, but the Righteouſneſs of God which is by Repentance, Love, Hope, the fear of God, holy Duties, then the Apoſtle had carried it clear againſt us; but he brings nothing that we have to join in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Righteouſneſs of God and Chriſt, but only Faith; therefore, the Apoſtle leaves all our inherent Graces and the Works that iſſued from them in this Text, to come under the Name of our own Righteouſneſs. As the Sin of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was perſonally in Guilt was likewiſe ours, ſo the Righteouſneſs of God is ſubjectively in Chriſt, and by Imputation ours. Conſider, then, all thoſe Works that proceed from ſanctifying Grace in you in order to conformity to the Law of God, they may all come under this Name and Notion of my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>p.</hi> 190, 191, 192.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Our own Righteouſneſs is utterly to be diſclaimed, that we may be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of God. Mark the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. ch. 4.6. Chriſt pulleth down the Righteouſneſs of your ſelves, which had the Chair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Servant muſt not ſit in the King's Chair: So Grace, tho' it be that whereby you may walk ſerviceable to God, yet you muſt not ſet it in the place of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56391:243"/> Jeſus Chriſt. — Yet the Apoſtle would not be without Holineſs, Sanctification and Obedience. One in Chriſt hath Vertue, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but how? as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Graces to walk with God, not as his Righteouſneſs with God; when the Sun ſhineth the Moon is put out, not out of her Orb or Courſe, but (as I may ſay) from her Rul. So the Righteouſneſs of God when you come to be juſtified by Faith, doth not aboliſh Holineſs and Sanctification (for they are and muſt be there together) but the ſetting up Obedience in the place of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a Cypher, is pull'd down from the place of Pounds. How doth that Apoſtle ſay, Not having mine own Righteouſneſs? I anſwer, not having it as my Righteouſneſs with God, then I ſhould put mine own in the place of Chriſt, not having it as concurrent with Chriſt.—That would make my Righteouſneſs Co-partner with him, not having it as a Motive to move him, then I ſhould put my Righteouſneſs in the place of free Grace; not having it as the Inſtrument whereby I take Chriſt; no, for then I ſhould put other Graces in the place of Faith.—Well then, in a word, having Holineſs or Righteouſneſs as a ſtock to trade with in the way of ſervice to God, not having it as a means to buy my Soul out of Hell: So you ſee the difference, that ſtill we have it, and yet we have it not.</p>
                           <p>But why is our own Righteouſneſs, that is inherent in us, to be diſclaimed?</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a way impoſſible for a Sinner to go to Heaven by, or to be Righteous by; that Ladder is too ſhort, tho' it ſeem long enough to you that have ſome Fragments of the Law.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Not having it, why? Becauſe there is another Righteouſneſs (and not this) which is called the Righteouſneſs of God: There is another <hi>Adam,</hi> and that <hi>Adam</hi> hath another Righteouſneſs for all to believe in, a Goſpel Righteouſneſs which is not of the Law. There is another Covenant God hath appointed whereby a Sinner muſt be juſt; now becauſe there is another, not this.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Becauſe one of theſe voids the other; if I have the Righteouſneſs of God, then mine own is void; if mine own, then the Righteouſneſs of God is void: As the Apoſtle ſaith of Grace, if Works, not Grace; and if Grace, not Works <hi>p.</hi> 192, 193, 194, 195.</p>

I anſwer, There is nothing hinders the Joy of God's People, but their Sins: thoſe, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſtand as a ſeparation betwixt God and them: Oh they ſtand as a cooling Card in all their Joys and Mirth. But when they return to <hi>Zion,</hi> they ſhall rejoice, in that they ſee that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, hath taken away all their Sins, the Scape-goat having carried them away into the Land of Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in that they ſee that all their Tranſgreſſions are blotted out as a Cloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they ſhall come by the ſight of the Glory of the Goſpel, and the Light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to behold this ſtate, that Chriſt hath brought them into, then all matter of Sorrow and Sighing ſhall fly away, and the bitterneſs of it ſhall be taken away; and then that which was the occaſion of that bitterneſs ſhall vaniſh too.</p>

Is it not God that blots out our Sins, and remembers them no more? Is not the Faith of this, the Ground-work of all true Joy? Have not ſome Believers leſs, and ſome more, according as their Faith is, and the Light of the Goſpel ſhines into their Hearts? And do they not, by virtue of this Joy and Peace in believing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their reſt? And may they not ſay, <hi>The Lord hath dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with me,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did? May they not return to their reſt, and ſit down in the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt? The Lord hath done all for me in Chriſt; who hath made him Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption. Is there any thing you can rejoice in, but what is done for us, or wrought in us by Chriſt? That Sin is taken away in the attonement and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, the great cauſe of my diſturbance.</p>

Or our doing before we have Chriſt or Life, the condition on which we have Chriſt and Life?</p>

                        <p>You muſt know it is this I ſaid: <q>A Freeman of Chriſt hath this freedom, Chriſt doth all his Work for him, as well as in him. He that is in bondage under the Law, muſt do every thing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he doth, he muſt do perfectly; that is an unſupportable thing and heavy bondage, for a Man to have more laid upon him than he can bear. The Freeman of Chriſt, conſidering that he is weak, poor and unable to work, Chriſt doth all his Work for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. The Holy Ghoſt tells us, he hath done all our Works in us; and in the Margin it is render'd, for us: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. Their freedom is, that they ſtand righteous in the ſight of God by that which Chriſt hath done for us; that they are as righteous as if they had done it in their own perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56391:246"/> We have our Peace, we have our Salvation only by the Righteouſneſs Chriſt hath done for us; but this doth hot take away our Obedience nor Services in reſpect of thoſe ends for which ſuch Services are required of Believers, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, to evidence our thankfulneſs, to profit Men, as Ordinances to meet God in, to make good what he hath promiſed; ſo far we are called out to Services, and walking uprightly, exactly, ſtrictly, according to the good pleaſure of God; and in regard of ſuch ends of Services, there is a gracious Freedom that the Freemen of Chriſt have by Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far forth as Services and Obedience are expected at a Freeman's hands, there is Chriſt by his Spirit, preſent with ſuch perſons, to help them in all ſuch kind of Services; ſo that they become ſtrong in the Lord, and the Power of his Might, to do the Will of God. Mark what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening me: of my ſelf I am able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, that ſtrengtheneth me, I am able to do all things,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>In my Diſcourſe from 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. this Objection is anſwered, <hi>p.</hi> 557. <hi>viz.</hi> There are many admire and adore the Doctrin of the Free-Grace of God; and yet are notoriouſly known to live in all manner of Lewdneſs and Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and upon this ground, Becauſe their Sins are laid on Chriſt. The Sum of the anſwer is, I confeſs I never knew any ſuch Monſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are many tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch; but I cannot ſay any thing to the truth of this Charge by mine own experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it may be there are ſuch, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch in his time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if there be ſuch, I muſt tell you they are the greateſt Monſters upon the face of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I dare boldly ſay they are the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Free-Grace, and that open Drunkards, Harlots, and Murderers, come infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of them in Abominations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But admit this, that the Grace of God hath been abuſed; hath not the whole Scripture been abuſed, Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? Is not Chriſt ſet for the fall and riſing of many in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Is he not a Rock of Offence? But in the mean time ſhall the Children want their Bread, becauſe the Dogs catch at it, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Shall not the Goſpel be preached, becauſe ſome abuſe it?</p>

                        <p>And what doth all this amount to, but what the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.23.

                        <p>Now let all Men judge how you have proved your Charge, by what you have alledged from my Sermons: Where is it that I ſay, Chriſt believes for us, or repents for us?

He ſaith this likewiſe batters to the ground that way of urging Men to Holineſs, which ſome hold forth; that if Men do not theſe and theſe good Works, and leave theſe and theſe Sins, then they muſt come under the Wrath of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Love of God conſtrains the Faithful, and not the Fear of Wrath.</p>

                        <p>And is not that good Doctrin, that the Grace of God only teacheth Holineſs; and that a Believer is not under the Law, or the Terrors thereof, for the learning of Holineſs, but under Grace; and are not they the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14? And doth he not lay the conſtraining force of the love of God on our delivery from Wrath, and tells us, that this is one great end of Chriſt's dying for us, that Men henceforce ſhould not live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them? It's a moſt grievous thing to ſee how you fly in the face of plain places of Scripture, with no ſmall ſcorn and contempt.</p>
                        <q>And theſe are my words concerning ſuch Preachers: They ought rather, after the Example of the Apoſtle, to excite them to theſe good Works, becauſe they are already freed from Wrath. Certainly this that I have delivered proves this ſufficiently, that the appearing of the Grace of God doth teach Men to do the Will of God effectually; the Love of God conſtrains the Faithful, and not the Fear of Wrath. But to conclude, Do not miſtake me, in the mean while, I have no thoughts as if Wrath and Vengeance were not to be preached and made known even to Believers; yea, Beloved, Wrath and Vengeance is to be made known to them, and that as the deſerts of Sin, and as the means to keep Men from Sin;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56391:247"/> but not in that way Men do ordinarily think, I mean thus, Wrath and Vengeance are not to be revealed as if Believers were to fear them, or as if Believers ſhould come under them. — But as Believers are ſecured and freed from them, that ſo they ſhould fear to commit and fall into Sin, and not for fear of coming under Wrath, but out of Love, becauſe God hath been ſo gracious to them, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the weight of ſo heavy Wrath and Diſpleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Now, Sir, your great Antagoniſt is withdrawn, I ſhall deal plainly with you, and briefly ſum up the Heads of theſe things wherein it hath manifeſtly appeared, by the foregoing Debates, that you have given abundant cauſe of juſt offence by your late Writings.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p n="1">1. That you have unjuſtly charged and miſrepreſented Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> by your ſelf, owned to have been a holy Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That you have falſly ſtated thoſe things which you call Truths and Errors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That you have vented your own erroneous Tenents, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove them agreeable to the Articles, Confeſſions and our Orthodox Proteſtant Writers, by perverting their Senſe, or miſapplying what they ſay, when as they are moſt repugnant to you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the ſaid Doctor, you charge him unjuſtly with thoſe things which are directly falſe; I ſhall give an Inſtance or two of it.</p>
                     <p>You ſay, this is one of his Errors, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. that he ſaith, <q>That if the Elect ſhould die before they believe, yea, when they are under the Dominion of Sin, and in the Practice of the groſſeſt Villanies, they are as much the Sons of God, and juſtified, as the Saints in Glory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas he expreſly denies the truth of this Charge in his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication he makes of himſelf againſt ſome, who in his Life-time, had reproached his Doctrin and Miniſtry as you do now, <hi>p.</hi> 637.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56391:250"/>They ſay, that I ſhould affirm, that if an elect Perſon ſhould die a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger and Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all kind of Prophaneneſs, he ſhall be ſaved.— He appeals to his Hearers, whether ever they heard him Preach any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and declares it a groſs, notorious and groundleſs Slander. — And his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words are, I ſaid before, and ſay again, That there is no elect Perſon, ſuppoſe him to be capable and come to years, ſhall die before he is called, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord give Faith to this Perſon to believe, and in ſome meaſure frame him to walk by the Spirit according to the Rule of the Goſpel.</q>
                     <p>The ſecond falſe Charge is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Err.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <q>That he ſhould make Chriſt the real Blaſphemer, Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he was ſo accounted of the Father.</q>
                     <p>Whereas he aſſerts and vindicates the Innocency of Chriſt's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he ſaith only that Chriſt was accounted a Tranſgreſſor from a real Tranſaction or Imputation of our Sins to him, in which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin the Scriptures are moſt full and expreſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You charge this Error upon him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <q>That Chriſt is offered to Blaſphemers, Murderers, and the worſt of Sinners, that they remaining ignorant, unconvinced and reſolved in their purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch, they may be aſſured they have a full Intereſt in Chriſt; and this only by concluding in their own minds upon this offer that Chriſt is theirs.</q>
                     <p>That Chriſt ought to be offered to the vileſt of Sinners, and they invited to come unto him, is ſound Goſpel-truth, tho' you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it for an Error.</p>
                     <p>And is it poſſible a Man of Conſcience can ſlander a Man (whom he owneth to be holy) with ſuch a notorious Falſhood? That he ſhould aſſert that Chriſt is offered to Men, that they remaining ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, unconvinced and reſolved in their purpoſe to continue ſuch, might be aſſured of their Intereſt in Chriſt, concluding only in their minds that Chriſt is theirs; this we have proved to be a notorious Slander.</p>
                     <p>Many other Falſhoods have been proved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for Miſrepreſentations they run thorow the whole Book. 1. Of Dr. <hi>C.</hi> that you may abuſe and expoſe him. 2. Of other noted Writers and Confeſſions, you have horridly miſrepreſented them to ſerve your turn, in aſſerting Error and condemning of Truth.</p>
                     <p>In miſrepreſenting Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> you have either perverted his meaning, and partially rehearſed his Expreſſions, or elſe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what Truth he aſſerts, and defends as great Errors.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, we have ſufficiently made it manifeſt in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the firſt part, and it hath abundantly been proved in the whole progreſs of our Debates.</p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56391:250"/>
                     <p>And here it is not amiſs to add a word or two to what is ſaid to your Error in the ſixth Debate, that you make a great Cry and Noiſe about, <hi>viz.</hi> That Dr. <hi>C.</hi> ſhould ſay, That Chriſt, while he bore Sin and was under the Puniſhment thereof, was the Object of God's abhorrence. The Doctor's words are, <hi>p.</hi> 180. All that hatefulneſs and loathſomneſs of Sin is put upon Chriſt, that he ſtands <hi>as it were</hi> the abhorred of the Father for a time. 1. You leave out [as it were.] 2. You improve this to a hatred of the Perſon of Chriſt, and a ſeparation of his Natures, upon his uſing the word Separation, as Exegetick of forſaking, both Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions concerning Sin and Chriſt. 3. You hereby manage your deſign of beating down the Doctrin of Chriſt's bearing God's Wrath and Curſe for us, as you do the Doctrin of his bearing Sin. 4. As to the word <hi>abhorred,</hi> upon a diligent Enquiry we find it to be a Scripture Expreſſion concerning Chriſt, yea, and of Chriſt, under his Sufferings of Wrath and Curſe for Sin; for tho' God never hated his Perſon in the higheſt of his Suffering (neither is it neceſſary any Judge paſſing Sentence on the worſt Criminal ſhould hate his Perſon) yet his Father dealing with him in a judicial way by the eye and hand of Juſtice, in this preſent ſtate, and ſtanding under the Charge of Sin, and thereby cloathed, as it were, with filthy Garments, is ſaid to be as it were abhorred of God; and its not only included in the word forſaken, the Syriack word <hi>Sabactani,</hi> and taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. where the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>As to the ſecond thing in which juſt Exceptions lie againſt your Book, we have this to charge, That you have not in all that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, fully and rightly ſtated Truths and Errors: For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You have not rightly divided Truth from Error, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them one with another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You have condemned Truth for Error, and aſſerted Error to be Truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You have ſtuffed your Poſitions with ambiguous Words and Terms, that inſtead of ſtating, you have perplexed them; and ſo that when you ſeem to ſpeak one thing, it's moſt apparent you mean another.</p>
                     <p>Let me but give a few Inſtances of many, that are more largely and particularly demonſtrated in the Debates.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. According to this threefold falſeneſs, you ſtate Truth and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in your 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Chapters, in the Doctrins of Chriſt's bearing our Sins, and Puniſhment for them.</p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56391:252"/>2. In the Doctrin of Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, you plainly deny it to be any other than as to Effects; which is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at all. That there was no change of Perſon betwixt Chriſt and us; That he ſuffered not in our ſtead; That Spots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in juſtified ones, as they ſtand juſtified before God, and therefore not perfectly juſtified; and then imputed Righteouſneſs muſt be imperfect, <hi>C.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You condemn it for an Error, to ſay, The Covenant of Grace, as to us, is not conditional; and that Faith is not a Federal Condition of it: And to ſay, The Covenant of Grace was made between the Father and Son, as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in him: Or that this Covenant-Tranſaction is pleadable by us: If all this be Error, what Truth is there in the Scripture and the Aſſembly? <hi>C.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 53, 58.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You condemn this for an Error, to ſay, Chriſt is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the worſt of ſinners, before they are willing to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and renounce all their Sins and Idols, <hi>C.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 81.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. You inſinuate a Condemnation of all Union to Chriſt before an Act of Faith, <hi>C.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 91.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You inſinuate Perſwaſion not to belong to the Nature of Faith, <hi>C.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 73. and make Faith and Repentance to juſtifie, as qualifying Conditions, <hi>C.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 102, 114.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. You inſinuate a Condemnation of this great Truth, aſſerted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, That he is the Way, Truth, and Life, in Juſtification, Sanctification, and Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>C.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 121.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Sum of what you deſign, in <hi>C.</hi> 14. is, to condemn this great Goſpel-Truth for Error; that a Believer is not to work from Life, but for Life, <hi>p.</hi> 153.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. You condemn all Ways of Aſſurance, beſides By-Signs and Marks found in us, among which Perſeverance is the greateſt.

It's not given him to will or do, but upon ſuppoſition of doing; nor to be juſtified or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but upon ſuppoſition of doing: So the Whole, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Believer's State, depends wholly upon doing; he is under a perfect Covenant of Works, and his State is a State of Tryal for Life, upon his doing, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s was; but a worſe, and hath more to do, and is leſs able.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Concerning the Goſpel of Christ.</head>
                        <p>ALtho' many Precepts of the Law of God are contained in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf teacheth, that we are not to render Evil for Evil, nor to look upon a Woman to luſt after her; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Precepts of the like nature. Yet we muſt not think, that the Goſpel of Chriſt is a New Law, whereby, as the Fathers of old under the Old Teſtament, were ſaved by an Old Law, ſo Men, now under the New Teſtament, are ſaved by a New Law.</p>
                        <p>For unleſs thou underſtand the word Law, generally for Doctrin, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſeveral times are wont to uſe the word Law; certainly the Goſpel of Chriſt, properly, is no Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> is wont to uſe the word Law, but is good and joyful Tydings concerning the Son of God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the only Expiator of our Sins and Appeaſer of the Wrath of God, our Redeemer and Saviour. Neither are the Precepts of the Law, which are contained in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writings, a New Law, but an Explication of the Old Law, according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, which are not darkly contained before in the Writings of the Prophets, but are repeated in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that the Severity of God's Law, and the Corruption of our Nature, being plainly laid open, we might be excited to enquire after and embrace Chriſt, revealed in his Goſpel; and that we ſhould be acquainted by what Rule our Life of Faith in Chriſt ſhould be directed. Wherefore, if we ought to ſpeak properly concerning the Law of God and the Goſpel of Chriſt, even as we are not to make Chriſt a New Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, ſeeing he hath not made a New Law, nor erected a New Politick Kingdom on Earth; ſo neither is the Goſpel to be turned into a New Law, which offer Eternal Salvation to the performers thereof. But we think, that it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is one and the ſame Natural and Moral Law, both of the Old and New Teſtament; and Eternal Salvation is not to be had by Men under the Old or New Teſtament for the Merits of the Works of the Law, but only for the ſake of the Merits of our Lord Jeſus by Faith.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt rehearſeth out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> his Office, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. for which he was ſent into this World, ſaying, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, in that he hath anointed me;</hi> he <hi>hath ſent me to Preach the Goſpel to the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. Here Chriſt teacheth, that it is not his proper Office to give a New Law which might terrifie and ſlay miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but to Preach the Goſpel, that might quicken and comfort them: See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10, 11.

                  <head>A POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>READER, having finiſhed my Dialogue, I am neceſſitated to add a word or two by way of Apology.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To clear my ſelf of an Imputation of concurring with certain Miniſters in exerting a Synodical Juriſdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee, that I have never been acceſſary to any ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they being utterly contrary to my Judgment; what they have done ſince <hi>Octob.</hi> 17. I am a Stranger to, and know not but by hear-ſay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas it hath been reported, that Matters were ſo adjuſted, as that an end was to be put to all Writing in this Controverſie; I muſt ſay, I know of no ſuch Agreement; ſomething there was which might give ſome ground to ſuch a Report, the Hiſtory whereof I ſhall for ſome Reaſons, forbear now to relate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome have been offended that I have continued to write Book after Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all is no more than the Anſwer of one Book ſent forth and recommended to the World; and therein I challenge the common Priviledge of all Men, to reply to any publiſhed Book that I think meet, and its not in the due power of any Men, or Society of Men, to abridge me of it, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they diſapprove thereof; and I am ſo far from loving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that if Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> hath done, I have done oppoſing him; but (notwithſtanding all Subſcriptions to Orthodox Articles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly or lately) if he continue to maintain his Doctrin, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture and the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Confeſſions and Catechiſms, he muſt expect to meet with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, maugre all the premeditated fury and rage that hath been from time to time expreſſed by the Aſſertors and Defenders of the ſaid Doctrins, both in Pulpit and Preſs, with all the ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marks of Reproach and Contempt, which they have branded their Oppoſers with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I cannot, but in honour to a Reverend Brother, make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular remark upon the great Pains he hath taken in his Sermons, (to expoſe one upon this account, in the height of Bitterneſs) and to print them for his cognizance. Not to ſay any thing now of his Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Reflections on the congregational Practice, or the wrong repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation which he hath given of the Matters at preſent in Debate (as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56391:255"/> another <hi>reverend Divine</hi> hath alſo lately) but only to admire that a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt</hi> can appear ſolemnly in the Preſence of God, to vent ſo much of his own Spirit. I underſtand one Sermon to be wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in ſetting all the black Characters upon one Man, as he could gather together, (who he means, all the Town, that hath heard or read the Sermon, hath judged) portraiting a Perſon to be an <hi>airy, imagined Piece of Spirituality, drawn over corrupt, rotten, putrid Fleſh, an angry, tumified Piece of proud Fleſh,</hi> with many ſuch Characters; which they that are deſirous to know more of, may ſee in the Original.</p>
                  <p>This ignominious Uſage I ſhall ſay no more to, but only, That tho' I have a ſinful, deceitful Heart, and know my ſelf to be worſe than any Man knows me to be, and ſhall always, I truſt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelf before the Lord; yet if this be to be vile in the Eyes of Men (bad or good) to defend the Truth according to my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Talent God hath or ſhall give me (as he calls me to it) I ſhall be yet more Vile; but ſtill looking upon what I do to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much of human Frailty, Hypocriſie, and all Corruption lurking in my naughty Heart, mingling itſelf with the beſt of my Duties and Services, <hi>That I count them all but Loſs and Dung for Christ,</hi> as the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. I could give many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Reaſons why, (among many others,) it did leaſt become this Reverend Perſon to launch forth into theſe Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> with a pretence to a ſweetning Spirit of Meekneſs, from the Temper which he hath manifeſted formerly, as well as now; and why he is a moſt incompetent Judge to paſs Sentence upon my Procedure about Matters in Controverſie (as I do declare all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to be, and he in a more eſpecial manner) not only becauſe he is of the Party engaged in this carnal Contention about words only (as he would have the World to underſtand it to be, ſince it could not be made an Impoſition as at firſt deſigned) but alſo becauſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as it were hath aſſerted, that he ne'er heard one ſide nor would, ſaying, That he never read Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Book (tho' he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to it) and therefore always refuſed to hear or argue any Allegations againſt the Doctrins contained in it. Now is it poſſible that ſuch an one ſhould give a true Verdict concerning Matter of Fact, or paſs a juſt Judgment upon either Party, who is declaredly ſo byaſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could ſay much more of this Nature, ſhould I proceed to give a true Narrative of Behaviours and Paſſages that have attended the Carnality of recommending Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Book to the World by Subſcriptions, which I ſhall forbear to do, unleſs I ſee I am
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56391:256"/> provoked to it. In the mean time I commend this Cauſe, and the weak management of it on my ſide, to the God of Truth, that weighs the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and judgeth righteouſly. And in Honor to that Reverend Divine, I ſay no more to what he hath ſo angrily preached and wrote, but am ready, notwithſtanding, to aſcribe it to that Infirmity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (it's poſſible) ſome Men think we are too much alike, and to bear a due reverend reſpect to him. But if, upon further provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I find <hi>I</hi> am forced to vindicate my ſelf from theſe Abuſes, and that in ſo doing, ſome Men find <hi>Quod me non impune laceſſunt,</hi> let them thank themſelves for it, as they may for all that they would make me ſo blame-worthy in.</p>

                     <head>A brief Reply to what Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams</hi> hath charged Mr. <hi>J. N.</hi> with, in the Preface to his Reply to Dr. <hi>C.</hi>

                     <p>FInding my ſelf traduced by ſuch as ſeem never to live ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly as in the Fire of Contention, who are ambitious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the Arms of Fame, and this wholly owing to what Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Williams</hi> hath publiſhed in the Preface to his late Book, called, <hi>A Defence,</hi> &amp;c. It's but needful I give the Reader a true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Account of my Concern in thoſe Matters, for which I am quoted and thus treated.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Particular for which I am charged is in reference to Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Works, <hi>viz. Mr.</hi> Nesbit, <hi>from credible Hands, informs me, the Aſſembly of Divines, deſired to have them burnt.</hi> In anſwer to this, I ſhall give the Impartial Account of this Story, with the Circumſtances that accompany it, and then leave my Cenſors to be Judges, how unfairly I am treated in this matter. Soon after this Reverend Author had appeared by the Preſs, in the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, I told him, I had been in ſome Company, where his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Dr. <hi>C.</hi>'s Works was occaſionally mentioned: To which one (naming to him both Place and Perſon) replied, They had been ſufficiently anſwered by the Aſſembly, for they burnt them. The ſame Paſſage being repeated, where he and ſeveral other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were preſent, it was moved, That one ſhould Write, to know of Dr. <hi>W.</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was able to give a full Account of the Truth or Falſhood of this Report; which was accordingly done: And the Anſwer returned and made known to this Author before his Printing, was in Sum thus: Tho' many of the Aſſembly did not approve of them, yet there was no ſuch thing as a Vote againſt them, that ever he heard of, or remembred. Now why this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56391:256"/> (from a Perſon that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was ſatisfied knew the whole of the Affair,) ſhould be omitted, and the other occaſional Report printed, is not eaſily conceivable, except we knew the meaning of the Reaſon I had from him (when expoſtulating his unkindneſs in this Action) <hi>viz. the Doctor's Anſwer was not ſo much to the purpoſe, therefore omitted.</hi> But they that know nothing of this, are prone to conjecture it ſeem'd deſigned to make my Name loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them, by whom, he can't but know, I deſire to be approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: However, I hope my Soul hath been better dieted, than to improve for juſt Reflection what is here offered by him</p>
                     <p>The next Paſſage is in reference to his own Book, <hi>viz. Mr.</hi> N. <hi>(tho' I never requeſted it) in my Houſe declared, if Mr.</hi> M. <hi>and three more had ſubſcribed, he would not have been unwilling to do it; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to add (Congregational) to the Divines in and about this City, who forbear to ſubſcribe only for prudential Conſiderations, which I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> I muſt acknowledge the freedom and familiarity I had, for ſome time (through our near Neighbourhood) in this Author's Company, encouraged me often to ſpeak my Thoughts without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſted to it, and that without the leaſt Jealouſie of having what I diſcourſed with him in private, made publick by the Preſs, and I not once acquainted with it; and I ſee had I come to act the part of a Plotter I had been diſcovered by an unſuſpected Informer. As to the whole of what paſt in this private Conference, it was with me of ſo little moment, that in a few days it was buryed in forgetfulneſs: So that when, by a Friend, theſe Paſſages were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of me, I remembred neither, but denyed both; till ſome time after, ſeriouſly revewing what Diſcourſe I had with him about this Concern, I remembred, that at my parting from him, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the word <hi>(Congregational)</hi> might be added, he having before told me the Names of ſeveral of that Perſuaſion that were, to his knowledge, Cordial for what he had done.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Paſſage, I have not once, or twice, but often ſolemnly proteſted to him, I did not remember any Particular ſo much as like it; which Anſwer I thought the moſt becoming Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to a Man of his Character, but it ſeems <hi>it was not to</hi> the <hi>purpoſe,</hi> and therefore omitted: Sure I am, Goſpel-truth, when <hi>truly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> carries more Demonſtration in it, than to need ſuch undue Methods and unmanly Weapons for the <hi>defence</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Paſſage is, <hi>He told Mr.</hi> Hume <hi>that if one or two Paſſages were rectified he would ſubſcribe my Book.</hi> To which Report I ſhall only make this ſhort return, That I may be a Stranger to my ſelf,
